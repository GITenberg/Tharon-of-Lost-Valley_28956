<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE GUN MAN&#8217;S HERITAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Lost Valley lay like a sparkling jewel,
fashioned in perfection, cast in the breast
of the illimitable mountain country&ndash;&ndash;and
forever after forgotten of God.</p>
<p>A tiny world, arrogantly unconscious of any
other, it lived its own life, went its own ways, had
its own conceptions of law&ndash;&ndash;and they were based
upon primeval instincts.</p>
<p>Cattle by the thousand head ran on its level
ranges, riders jogged along its trail-less expanses,
their broad hats pulled over their eyes, their six-guns
at their hips. Corvan, its one town, ran its
nightly games, lined its familiar streets with
swinging-doored saloons.</p>
<p>Toward the west the Ca&ntilde;on Country loomed
behind its sharp-faced cliffs, on the east the rolling
ranges, dotted with oak and digger-pine, went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
gradually up to the feet of the stupendous peaks
that cut the sapphire skies.</p>
<p>Lost indeed, it was a paradise, a perfect place
of peace but for its humans. Through it ran the
Broken Bend, coming in from the high and jumbled
rocklands at the north, going out along the
sheer cliffs at the south.</p>
<p>Out of its ideal loneliness there were but two
known ways, and both were worth a man&#8217;s best
effort. Down the river one might drive a band
of cattle, bring in a loaded pack train, single file
against the wall. That was a twelve days&#8217; trip.
Up through the defiles at the west a man on foot
might make it out, provided he knew each inch of
the Secret Way that scaled False Ridge.</p>
<p>It was spring, the time of greening ranges and
the coming of new calves. Soft winds dipped and
wantoned with Lost Valley, in the Ca&ntilde;on Country
shy flowers, waxen, heavy-headed on thin
stems, clung to the rugged walls.</p>
<p>All day the sun had shone, mild as a lover,
coaxing, promising. The very wine of life was
a-pulse in the air.</p>
<p>All day Tharon Last had sung about her work
scouring the boards of the kitchen floor until they
were soft and white as flax, helping old Anita with
the dinner for the men, seeing about the number
of new palings for the garden. She had swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
every inch of the deep adobe house, had fixed over
the arrangement of Indian baskets on the mantel,
had filled all the lamps with coal-oil. She was
very careful with the lamps, trimming the wicks to
smokeless perfection, for oil was scarce and precious
in Lost Valley, as were all outside products,
since they must come in at long intervals and in
small quantities. And as she worked she sang,
wild, wordless melodies in a natural voice as rich
as a harp. That voice of Tharon&#8217;s was one of the
wonders of Lost Valley. Many a rider went by
that way on the chance that he might catch its
golden music adrift on the breeze, her father&#8217;s
men came up at night to hear its martial stir, its
tenderness, for the voice was the girl, and Tharon
was an unknown quantity, sometimes all melting
sweetness, sometimes fire that flashed and was
still.</p>
<p>So on this day she sang, since she was happy.
Why, she did not know. Perhaps it was because
of the six new puppies in the milk-house, rolling
in awkward fatness against their shepherd
mother, whose soft eyes beamed up at the girl
in beautiful pride. Perhaps it was because of the
springtime in the air.</p>
<p>At any rate she worked with all the will and
pleasure of youth in a congenial task, and the
roses of health bloomed in her cheeks. The sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
itself shone in her tawny hair where the curls
made waves and ripples, the blue skies of Lost
Valley were faithfully reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>Her skin was soft-golden, the enchanting skin
of some half-blonds which can never be duplicated
by all the arts of earth, and her full mouth was
scarlet as pomegranates.</p>
<p>Sometimes old Anita who had raised her, would
stop and look at her in wonder, so beautiful was
she to old and faithful eyes.</p>
<p>And not alone to Anita was she entirely lovely.</p>
<p>There was not a full grown man in Lost Valley
who would not go many a mile to look upon her&ndash;&ndash;with
varying desires. Few voiced their longings,
however, for Jim Last was notorious with his guns
and could protect his daughter. He had protected
her for twenty years, come full summer, and he
asked no odds of any. His eyes were like
Tharon&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;blue and changing, with odd little lines
that crinkled about them at the corners, elongating
them in appearance. He was a big man, vital
and quiet. The girl took her stature from him.
Her flashes of fire came from her mother, of
whom she knew little and of whom Jim Last said
nothing. Once as a child she had asked him, after
the manner of children, about this mother of dim
memories, and his eyes had hazed with a look of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
suffering that scared her, he had struck his palm
upon a table, and said only:</p>
<p>&#8220;She was an angel straight out of Heaven.
Don&#8217;t ask me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tharon had not asked again, though she had
wondered much.</p>
<p>Sometimes old Anita, become garrulous with
age, mumbled in the twilight when the rose and
the lavendar lights swept down the eastern ramparts
and across the rolling range lands, and the
girl gleaned scattered pictures of a gentle and
lovely creature who had come with her father out
of a mystic country somewhere &#8220;below.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Below&#8221; meant down the river and beyond, an
unnamable region.</p>
<p>In the big living room there was one relic of
this mysterious mother, a tiny melodeon, its rosewood
case a trifle marred by unknown hardships,
its ivory keys yellow with age. It had two small
pedals and two slender sticks which fitted therein
and pushed the bellows up and down when one
trampled upon them. And to Tharon this little
old instrument was wealth of the Indies. The low
piping of its reedy notes made an accompaniment
of surpassing sweetness when she sat before it and
sang her wordless melodies. And just as she found
music in her throat without conscious effort, so she
found it in her fingers, deep, resonant chords for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
her running minors, thin, trickling streams of lightness
for her own slow notes.</p>
<p>The sun had turned to the west in its majestic
course and Tharon, the noon work over, drew up
the spindle-legged stool and sat down to play to
herself and Anita. The old woman, half Mexic,
half Indian, drowsed in a low chair by the eastern
window, her toil-hard hands clasped in her lap, a
black <i>reboso</i> over her head, though the day was
warm as summer. A kitten frisked in the sunlight
at the open door, wild ducks, long domesticated,
squalled raucously down the yards, some
cattle slept in the huge corrals and the little world
of Last&#8217;s Holding was at peace. It seemed that
only the girl idling over the yellowed keys, was
awake.</p>
<p>For a long and happy hour Tharon sat so, sometimes
opening her pretty throat in ambitious
flights of sound, again humming lowly&ndash;&ndash;and that
was enchanting, as if one sang lullabies to flaxen
heads on shoulders.</p>
<p>And it did enchant one&ndash;&ndash;a man who stood for
the better part of that hour at the edge of the
deep window in the adobe wall and watched the
singer.</p>
<p>He was a splendid figure of a man, tall, broad,
muscular, built for strength and endurance. His
face was unduly lined, even for his age, which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
near fifty, but the eyes under the arched black
brows were vital as a hawk&#8217;s. He wore the customary
garments of the Lost Valley men, broad
sombrero, flannel shirt, corduroys and cowboy
boots, stitched and decorated above their high
heels. At his hips hung two guns, spurs clinked
when he stepped unguardedly. He rarely stepped
that way, however.</p>
<p>When presently the girl at the melodeon ceased
and drew the lid over the keys with reverent
fingers, he moved silently back a pace or two along
the wall. Then he waited. As he had anticipated,
she came to the door to look upon the budding
world, and for another moment he watched her
with a strange expression. Then he swung forward
and let the spurs rattle. Tharon flashed to
face him like a startled animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Tharon,&#8221; he said and smiled. The
girl stared at him with quick insolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>
<p>He came close to the doorway, put one hand
on the facing, the other on his hip and leaned
near. She drew back. He reached out suddenly
and gripped her wrist in fingers that bit
like steel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty,&#8221; he said, while his dark eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>Tharon flung her whole young strength
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
against his grip with a twisting wrench and came
free. The quick, tremendous effort left her calm.
And she did not retreat a step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; said the man admiringly, &#8220;little wildcat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you want?&#8221; she asked sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; he answered swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck Courtrey,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you might own
an&#8217; run Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;all but one outfit. You ain&#8217;t
never run Last nor put your dirty hand on th&#8217;
Holdin&#8217;. An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all. You never will. If
you ever touch me again, I&#8217;ll tell Dad Jim an&#8217; he&#8217;ll
kill you. I&#8217;d a-told him before when you met me
that day on the range, only I didn&#8217;t want his honest
hands smutted up with such as you. He&#8217;s had
his killin&#8217;s before&ndash;&ndash;but they was always in fair-an&#8217;-open.
You he&#8217;d give no quarter&ndash;&ndash;if he knew
what you ben askin&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyes narrowed evilly. They became
calculating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to feed th&#8217; buzzards?&#8221; the girl
asked with an insulting peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;ll remember that speech some
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember an&#8217; be damned,&#8221; said Tharon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;Now kindly take your dirty carcass off Last&#8217;s
Holding&ndash;&ndash;back to your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire was flashing a little in her blue eyes
as she spoke, and she half turned to enter the
house.</p>
<p>As she did so, Courtrey flung out an arm and
caught her about the shoulders. He drew her
against him with the motion and kissed her square
on the lips. For a second his narrowed eyes were
drunken.</p>
<p>As he loosed her Tharon gasped like a swimmer
sinking.</p>
<p>She put up a hand and drew it across her mouth,
which was pale as ashes with sudden rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Courtrey, and swung away around
the wall of the house.</p>
<p>There were no more artless songs that day at
Last&#8217;s Holding. Anita was awake and peering
with dim eyes when Tharon came in from the
door sill.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mi querida</i>,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;it&#8217;s time to begin
supper. Th&#8217; boys&#8217;ll soon be comin&#8217; in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, si</i>,&#8221; said Anita, &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Jos&eacute; to cut the
fresh beef&ndash;&ndash;it has hung long enough in the cooling
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supper at Last&#8217;s was a lively affair. At the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
long tables in the eating room the riders gathered,
lean, tanned men, young mostly, all alert, quick-eyed,
swift in judgment. Their days were full and
earnest enough, running Last&#8217;s cattle on the Lost
Valley ranges. The evenings were their own, and
they made the most of them. The big house was
free to them, and they made it home, smoking,
playing cards on the living room table under the
hanging lamp, mulling over the work of the day,
and begging Tharon to sing to them, sometimes
with the instrument, sometimes sitting in the deep
east window, when the moon shone, and then they
turned out the light and listened in adoring
rapture.</p>
<p>For Last&#8217;s girl was the rose of the Valley, the
one absolutely unattainable woman, and they worshipped
her accordingly.</p>
<p>Not that she was aloof. Far from it. In her
deep heart the whole bunch of boys had a place;
singly and collectively. They were her private
property, and she would have been inordinately
jealous of any one of them had he slipped
allegiance.</p>
<p>As the purple and crimson veils began to drape
the eastern ramparts where the forests thickened
and swept up the slopes, these riders began to
come in across the range, driving the herds before
them. Running cattle in Lost Valley was no child&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
play. Any small bunch of cows left out at night
was not there by dawn. Eternal vigilance was the
price of safety, and then they were not always safe.
Witness poor Harkness, a year ago shot in the
back and left to die alone&ndash;&ndash;his band run off in
daylight.</p>
<p>They had found him too late, pitifully propped
against a stone, the cigarette, he had tried to light
to comfort him, dead in his nerveless hand.
Tharon had wept and wept for Harkness, for he
had been a good comrade, open-hearted and
merry. And deep in her soul she harboured dim
longings for justice on his murderer&ndash;&ndash;revenge, if
you will.</p>
<p>Tonight she thought of him, somehow, as she
went about the supper work along with Anita and
Jos&eacute; and pretty dark Paula. She stood a moment
on the broad stone at the kitchen door, a dish
of butter from the springhouse under the poplars
in her hand, and watched Billy Brent and Curly
bring in a bunch from up Long Meadow way. She
thought how bright the spotted cattle looked, how
lithe and graceful the men, and then her eyes
lighted as they always did when she beheld the
horses of Last&#8217;s Holding&ndash;&ndash;the horses of the
Finger Marks.</p>
<p>Billy rode Redbuck, Curly Drumfire, and they
were princes of a royal blood, albeit Nature&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
strain alone. Slim, spirited, wiry, eager heads up,
manes flying, bright hoofs flashing in the late
sunlight, they came home to Last&#8217;s after a long
day&#8217;s work, fresh as when they went out at
dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; ever floors them,&#8221; Tharon said aloud
to herself. &#8220;Wonderful creatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>She set the butter down on the rock at her feet,
cupped her hands about her lips and sent out a
keen, clear call, two notes, one rising, one falling.
It had a livening, compelling quality.</p>
<p>Instantly Drumfire flung up his head and
answered it with a ringing whistle, though he did
not lose a stride in the flying curve he was performing
to head a stubborn yearling that refused in
stiff-tailed arrogance to go into the corrals.</p>
<p>The girl smiled and, stooping, picked up her
dish and entered.</p>
<p>It was late before the last straggler was in from
the range. The boys washed at the big sink on the
porch, and were ready for the hearty fare that
steamed in the lamp-lighted room. For the last
hour Tharon had been watching the eastern slopes
for her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s ridin&#8217; late, Anita,&#8221; she said anxiously as
the men trooped in with the usual jest and
laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went far, no doubt, <i>Corazon,&#8221;</i> said old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Anita comfortably. &#8220;He goes so fast on El Rey
that time as well as distance flies beneath the
shining hoofs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anita was like her people, mystic and soft-spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the girl gently, &#8220;I forget, El
Rey is mighty. He went very far I make no
doubt. We&#8217;ll hear him comin&#8217; soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she poured steaming coffee in the cups
about the table, smiling down in the eyes upturned
to hers. Billy, Curly, Bent Smith, Jack Masters
and Conford, the foreman, they all had a love-look
for her, and the girl felt it like a circling
guerdon. She was grateful for the sense of security
that seemed to emanate from her father&#8217;s
riders, a bit wistful withal, as if, for the first time
in her life, she needed something more than she
had always had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did Dad go, Billy?&#8221; she asked,
&#8220;north or south?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;North,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;he rode th&#8217; Cup Rim
range today.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the meal, a trifle silent in deference to
Tharon&#8217;s silence, was done, the men rose awkwardly.
They stood a moment, looking about,
undecided.</p>
<p>Conford picked them up with his eyes and
nodded out. He felt that just maybe the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
would rather be alone. But Tharon stopped the
reluctant egress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, boys,&#8221; she said, &#8220;come on in th&#8217;
room. There&#8217;s no moon tonight.&#8221; But she did
not play on the melodeon. Instead she sat in the
deep window that looked over the rolling uplands
and was quiet, listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn out th&#8217; light, Bent,&#8221; she said, &#8220;somehow
I feel like shadows tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they sat about in the great room, black with
the darkness of the soft spring night, and like the
true worshippers they were, they did not speak.
Only the red butts of their cigarettes glowed and
faded, to glow again and again fade out. Tharon
sat curled in the window, her graceful limbs
drawn up to her chin, her eyes half closed, her
keen ears open like a forest creature&#8217;s. She was
listening for the marked rhythm of the great El
Rey, the clap-clap, clap-clap of the king of Last&#8217;s
Holding as he singlefooted down the hollow slopes
of the lifting eastern range.</p>
<p>And as she waited she thought of many things.
Odd little happenings of her childhood came back
to her&ndash;&ndash;the time she had caught her father killing
the winter&#8217;s beef, had wept in hysterical pity
and forbidden him to finish.</p>
<p>They had had no meat those long months following&ndash;&ndash;and
she had so tired of beans, that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
had never been able to eat them since. She smiled
in the dusk as she recalled Jim Last&#8217;s life-long
indulgence of her.</p>
<p>And the time she had wanted to make her own
knee-short dresses as long as Anita&#8217;s, to sweep the
floors, with fringe upon them and stripes of bright
print.</p>
<p>She had worn them so&ndash;&ndash;at twelve&ndash;&ndash;until she
found that they hindered the free use of her
young limbs in mounting a horse, free-foot and
bareback. Then, once again the memory of her
father&#8217;s face when she questioned him concerning
her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; she said suddenly, smiling to herself,
&#8220;did you ever know a man like my
dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a movement among the lounging
riders, a shifting of position, a striking of cigarette
ash.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Billy promptly, &#8220;there hain&#8217;t
another man&#8217;s good with a gun as him, not anywhere&#8217;s
in Lost Valley. Not even Buck Courtrey
himself. I&#8217;d back Jim Last against him, even, in
fair-draw. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;only&ndash;&ndash;listen&ndash;&ndash;Glory!&#8221;
she added slipping down from the window
to stand quietly in the gloom, &#8220;that&#8217;s him
now! I was wishin&#8217; hard he&#8217;d come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Say&ndash;&ndash;listen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Why,&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; gone wrong with El
Rey&#8217;s feet! 1&ndash;&ndash;2&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;3, 4, 5, 6&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;1&ndash;&ndash;2&ndash;&ndash;Boys&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s
breakin&#8217;! Th&#8217; king ain&#8217;t singlefootin&#8217;
right, for th&#8217; first time since Jim Last put a halter
on him! Come&ndash;&ndash;come quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ordinarily Tharon was a bit slow in her movements,
as the very graceful often are. Now she
was across the room to the western door before a
man had moved. They joined her there and she
stood at attention, one hand at her breast, the
breath held still in her throat. The light, shining
through from the eating room beyond, made a
halo of her tawny hair. Silently the riders
grouped about her and listened.</p>
<p>Sure enough. Down along the range that rang
as some open stretches do, there came the clip-clap
of a hurrying horse, only now the hoof beats
were regular for a little space, to break, halt,
start on, and again ring true in the beautiful syncopation
of the born singlefooter. The king was
coming home, but, alas! not as he had ever come
before, in full flight, proud and powerful. He
held his speed and sacrificed his certainty to the
man who clung desperately to the saddle horn and
swayed in wide arcs, so that he must shift continually
to keep under him.</p>
<p>Into the dim glow of light at the open door
came El Rey at last, great blue-silver stallion, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
big eyes shining like phosphorus, his nostrils wide
with horror of the pungent crimson wash that
painted his right shoulder.</p>
<p>He stopped at the door-stone, his duty done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221; screamed Tharon, shrill as a bugle,
for Jim Last, white and dull as a moon in fog, let
go his desperate hold on the pommel and slid,
deadweight, into the reaching arms that circled
him.</p>
<p>They carried him into the living room. Before
they had him safely on the wide couch where the
Indian blankets glowed, Tharon, trembling but
efficient, had lighted the hanging lamp above the
table.</p>
<p>Then she pushed the men aside and knelt beside
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; she said clearly, &#8220;Jim! Jim Last!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gaining of his goal had been too much.
For a moment the flickering light in him died down
to ashes. Tharon, her face as white as his own,
waited in a man-like quiet. She held his stiffened
hands and her eyes burned upon his features. With
a deadly knowledge she was printing them indelibly
upon her heart.</p>
<p>Presently Jim Last sighed and opened his eyes.
They sought hers and he smiled, a tender lighting
from within. He fumbled for the buckle of
his gun-belt. The girl unclasped it and pulled it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
free. She noticed that both guns were in their
holsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it on,&#8221; whispered the master of Last&#8217;s
Holding.</p>
<p>Without a question Tharon stood up and
buckled the belt about her slender waist.</p>
<p>Her father raising himself with difficulty on an
elbow, wet his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon, my girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;show your dad
th&#8217; backhand flip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange play, this, when every second counted,
but Last&#8217;s daughter obeyed him to the letter.</p>
<p>She stepped clear by the table, stood at attention
a second, and, with a peculiar outward whirl,
lightning-quick, of her two wrists, had him covered
with the big blue guns.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good as I learned ye,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;make
it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Tharon swiftly.</p>
<p>The man closed his eyes, swayed, recovered as
Conford caught him, and brightened again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now th&#8217; under-sling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she obeyed, replacing the weapons,
standing that second at attention, and flipping
them from the holsters so quickly that the eye
could scarcely catch the motion. Both draws were
peculiar&ndash;&ndash;and peculiarly Last&#8217;s own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
&#8220;Good girl,&#8221; he said with a husk grown suddenly
in his voice, &#8220;take&ndash;&ndash;three hours&ndash;&ndash;a day. I
want t&#8217; leave you th&#8217; best gun-handler in Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;because,
my girl&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;have&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;pro&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased, wilting forward in Conford&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Then he opened his eyes again for one last smile
at the daughter he had loved above all things on
earth, save and except the memory of the woman
who had given her to him.</p>
<p>For once in her life Tharon did not wait his
finished speech. She saw the Hand reach out of
the shadows and flung herself upon his breast
where the blood still seeped and fairly forced the
last flutter of life to brighten in him. She kissed
his rugged cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Dad,&#8221; she called into his dulling
senses, &#8220;tell me who? I&#8217;ll get him, so help me
God!&#8221; and she loosed one hand to cross herself,
as old Anita had taught her.</p>
<p>But the promise was late. None knew whether
or not Jim Last heard it, for before the last
word was done the breath had ceased in his
throat.</p>
<p>Another twilight came down upon Lost Valley.
The wide ranges lay dim and mysterious, grey and
pink and lavendar, as if the hand of a Master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Painter had coloured them, as indeed it had.
The Rockface at the west was black with shadow
for all its rugged miles, the eastern uplands
were bathed and aglow with purplish crimson
light.</p>
<p>In Corvan lights twinkled all up and down the
one main street. Horses were tied at the hitch-racks
and among them were the Ironwoods from
Courtrey&#8217;s Stronghold, beautiful big creatures,
blood-bay, black-pointed, noticeable in any bunch.
There were no Finger Marks, however, the blue
roans, red roans and buckskins with the four black
stripes on the outside of the knee, as if one had
slapped them with a tarred hand, which hailed
from Last&#8217;s. There were horses from all up and
down the Valley. Cow ponies and half-breeds of
the Ironwood stock which Courtrey would not
keep at the Stronghold but was too close to kill,
shouldered pintos from the Indian settlements,
big, half-wild horses from over the mountains at
the North. Inside the brightly lighted saloons
men passed back and forth, drank neat liquor at
the worn bars, played at the green felt and canvas
covered tables. At one, The Golden Cloud, more
pretentious than the rest, there foregathered the
leading spirits of the Valley. Here Courtrey came
and played and drank, his henchmen with him.
He was in high mettle this night. Always a contained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
man, slow to laughter and to speech, he
seemed to have unbent more than usual, to respond
to the human nature about him. He was not playing
steadily as was his wont. He took a turn at
poker with three men from the south of the Valley
where the river ran out of the Bottle Neck,
won a hand or two, threw down the cards and
swung away to talk a moment with this one, listen
a moment where those two spoke of hushed matters.
Always when he came near he was accorded
deference. There was nothing sacred
from Courtrey of the Stronghold, seated like a
feudal place at the north head of Lost Valley, no
conversation so private that he could not come in
on it if he chose.</p>
<p>For Courtrey was the king of the country, undisputed
sovereign, the best gun man north of the
Rio Grand and south of the Line, if one excepted
Jim Last. With him tonight were Black Bart, tall,
swarthy, gimlet-eyed, a helf-breed Mexican, and
Wylackie Bob his right-hand man. Without these
two he seldom moved. They were both able lieutenants,
experts with firearms. A formidable trio,
the three went where and when they listed, and
few disputed their right-of-way.</p>
<p>Courtrey, a smile in his dark eyes, the wide
black hat at an angle on his iron-grey hair, leaned
against the high bar and scanned the crowded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
room where the riders played and laughed and
swore with abandon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard anything more about Ca&ntilde;on Jim?&#8221;
he asked Bullard, the proprietor of The Golden
Cloud, &#8220;ain&#8217;t come in yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullard shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;nor he won&#8217;t, according to my notion.
Think he mistook th&#8217; False Ridge drop. Ain&#8217;t no
man could make it up again without th&#8217; hammer
spike an&#8217; rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t know. Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; mused
Courtrey. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always thought it could be done.
There ought to be a way on th&#8217; other side, seems
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>ought</i> an&#8217; <i>is</i> is two diff&#8217;rent things,
Buck,&#8221; grinned Bullard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; nodded the king, &#8220;sure. An&#8217; yet&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>A soft hand touched Courtrey&#8217;s shoulder with
a subtle caress. He wheeled on the instant, ready,
alert. Then he smiled and reaching up, took the
hand and held it openly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Lola,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how goes it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomer was a woman, full, rounded,
dark, and she was past-master of men&ndash;&ndash;as witness
the slow glance that she turned interestedly out
over the teeming room, even while the pulse in the
wrist in Courtrey&#8217;s clasp leaped like a racer. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
was a perfect specimen of a certain type, beautiful
after a resplendent fashion, full of eye and lip,
confident, calm. She was brilliantly clad in crimson
and black, and rings of value shone on her
ivory-like hands.</p>
<p>Lola of the Golden Cloud was known all over
Lost Valley. Men who had no women worshipped
her&ndash;&ndash;and some who had, also. At the
Stronghold at the Valley&#8217;s head there was a
woman who hated her, though she had never set
eyes on her&ndash;&ndash;Courtrey&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>If Lola knew this she had never mentioned it,
wise creature that she was. Proud of her beauty
and her power she had reigned at The Golden
Cloud in supreme indifference, even to her men
themselves, it seemed, though hidden undercurrents
ran strong in her. Which way they tended
many a reckless buck of Lost Valley would have
given much to know, among them Courtrey
himself.</p>
<p>Now she pulled her hand away from him and
sauntered over to a table where five men sat
playing, laid it upon the shoulder of one of
them, leaned down and looked at the cards in
his hand.</p>
<p>The man, a tall stripling in a silver-studded
belt, looked up, flattered.</p>
<p>Courtrey by the bar watched her, still smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Then he turned back to Bullard and went on with
his conversation.</p>
<p>Over by the wall a man on a raised dais began
to tune an ancient fiddle.</p>
<p>Two more women came in from somewhere at
the back, a big blooming girl by the name of
Sadie, and a small red-head, tragically faded, with
soft brown eyes that should never have looked
upon Bullard&#8217;s. Two men rose and took them as
the tune, an old-fashioned waltz, began to ripple
under the fingers of the fiddler, who was a born
musician, and the four swung down between the
tables and the bar. The Golden Cloud was in
full swing, running free for the night, though the
soft twilight was scarcely faded from the beautiful
country without.</p>
<p>Slip&ndash;&ndash;step, slip&ndash;&ndash;step&ndash;&ndash;went the dancing feet
to the accompaniment of rattling spurs. These
men were lithe and active, able to dance with
amazing grace in chaps and the full accoutrement
of the rider. They even wore their broad
brimmed hats.</p>
<p>Why should they not, since none objected?</p>
<p>Bullard, solid, stocky, red-faced, leaned on his
bar and watched the busy room with pleased eyes.</p>
<p>He did not hear a voice which called his name,
once or twice, among the jumble of sounds. Presently
an odd figure came round the end of the bar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
from a door that opened there into the mysterious
back regions of the place and elbowed in to face
him.</p>
<p>This was a little old man, weazened and bent,
his unkempt head thrust forward from hunched
shoulders. He dragged two grain sacks behind
him, and he was so grotesquely bow-legged that
the first sight of him always provoked laughter.
This was old Pete the snow-packer, bound on his
nightly trip to the hills. Outside his burros
waited, their pack-saddles empty.</p>
<p>By dawn they would come down from the
world&#8217;s rim, the grain sacks bulging with hard-packed
snow for the cooling of Bullard&#8217;s liquor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; he said when he faced his employer,
&#8220;here &#8217;tis time t&#8217; start an&#8217; there ain&#8217;t a damned
bit o&#8217; grub put up fer me! Ef ye don&#8217;t make that
pig-tailed Chink pay &#8217;tention t&#8217; my wants, I quit!
I quit, I tell ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he emphasized his vehement protest by
whirling the bags over his head and flailing them
upon the floor.</p>
<p>A roar of laughter greeted him, which brought
dim tears of indignation to his old eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t care a damn!&#8221; he whimpered in
impotent rage. &#8220;Jes&#8217; &#8217;cause it&#8217;s me. Ef &#8217;twas
yer ol&#8217; Chink, now&ndash;&ndash;if &#8217;twas him, th&#8217; ol&#8217; he-pigtail,
ye&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Pete,&#8221; said Bullard, slapping an
indulgent hand on the grotesque shoulder, &#8220;You
go tell Wan Lee that if he don&#8217;t put up th&#8217; best
lunch in camp for you, an&#8217; <i>muy pronto</i> at that,
I&#8217;ll come in an&#8217; skin him alive. Tell him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bullard was never to finish that sentence.</p>
<p>There was a sound of running horses stopping
square at the rack without, the rattle of chains,
the creak of saddles.</p>
<p>Booted feet struck the boards of the porch, and
almost upon the instant the great iron door of
The Golden Cloud swung inward.</p>
<p>The dancers stopped in their stride, the players
laid down their cards, the noise of the room
ceased with the suddenness that characterized
the time and place, for Lost Valley was quick
upon the trigger, tragedy often swept in upon
hilarity.</p>
<p>In the opening stood Tharon Last, her blue
eyes black and sparkling, her tawny skin cream
white, her lips tight-set and pale. She wore a
plain dark dress that buttoned up the front, and
at her hips there hung her father&#8217;s famous guns.
Her two hands rested on their butts.</p>
<p>Behind her head against the starlight there was
the dim suggestion of massed sombreros.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood so in breathless silence,
scanning the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>Then her glance came to rest on the face of
Buck Courtrey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; she said clearly, &#8220;we buried Jim Last
today. El Rey brought him home last night&ndash;&ndash;finished.
You all know he was a gun man&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217;
best in these parts. It was no gun man that killed
him, in fair-an&#8217;-open, for he was shot in th&#8217; back.
It was a skunk, a coyote, a son-of-th&#8217;-devil, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the last word there was a lightning movement
at the bar as Courtrey&#8217;s hand flashed at his
hip, a flash of fire, a shot that went high and
lodged in the deep beam above the door, for the
weazened form of the snow-packer had leaped up
against him in the same instant.</p>
<p>The girl had not moved. Her hands still
rested on the guns in their holsters. Now a grim
smile curled her mouth, but her eyes did not laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; kill him,&#8221; she said quietly, still
in that clear voice, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll do it accordin&#8217; to th&#8217;
law Jim Last laid down to me all my life&ndash;&ndash;in certainty.
I know&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;ll prove. We hain&#8217;t no
assassins, Jim Last an&#8217; me. Some day I&#8217;ll draw&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
my father&#8217;s killer must beat me to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without another word Tharon backed out on
the porch, the door swung to at the pull of an
unseen hand on the iron strap by the hinge.</p>
<p>There was again the rattle and creak, the whirl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
of hoofs, and in the breathless stillness that lasted
for a few seconds, there came to the strained ears
in the Golden Cloud the clip-clap of a singlefooter
as the great El Rey led out of town.</p>
<p>Then Buck Courtrey, flushed and unsmiling,
sent his coldly narrowed eyes over the crowded
room, man by man. Laughter came, a trifle
cracked and forced, cards slapped on the tables,
chairs creaked as the players drew up again, the
dancers swung into step as the fiddle took up its
interrupted strain.</p>
<p>Only Lola, over by the door, looked for a pregnant
moment at Courtrey&#8217;s face, and shut her lips
in a hard, straight line.</p>
<p>Then, lastly, the cold eyes of the king came
down to rest upon the weazened figure of the
snow-packer busily engaged in rolling up his sacks
for departure. If the strange old creature knew
and felt their promise, he gave no sign as he
trundled himself outdoors on his bandy legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skunks,&#8221; said Old Pete, as he fumbled with
his straps about the patient burros, &#8220;are plumb
pizen t&#8217; pure flesh.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE HORSES OF THE FINGER MARKS</h3>
</div>
<p>At Last&#8217;s Holding a change had taken place.
The sun of spring still shone as brightly,
the work of the place went on as usual.
The riders went at dawn and came at dusk, their
herds lowing across the rolling green spaces, the
days were as busy as they had ever been, but it
seemed as if Last&#8217;s waited for something that
would never happen, for some one who would
never come. Conford, quiet, forceful, businesslike,
carried on the work without a ripple. To a
casual eye all things were as they had been. But
to the keen eyes in the tanned faces of Last&#8217;s
riders the change was appallingly apparent. They
saw it creep day by day into their lives, felt it
in the very atmosphere, and it was grim and
promising.</p>
<p>Old Anita felt it and watched with dim and
wistful eyes. Pretty young Paula from the Pomo
Indian settlement far to the north of the Valley
under the Rockface felt it and was more silent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
cat-like of step than ever. Jos&eacute;, always full of
laughter at his outside work, was sobered.</p>
<p>For this change was not material, but spiritual,
and it had to do with Tharon, who was now the
mistress of Last&#8217;s.</p>
<p>She no longer sang her wordless songs, no
longer played for hours on the little old melodeon
by the western door. Something had gone from
the brightness of her face, a shadow had come instead.
She was just as swift and gentle in her
care for all the things of every day, as efficient and
painstaking, but she did not laugh, and the tiny
lines that had characterized her father&#8217;s blue eyes,
began to show distinctly about her own.</p>
<p>They began to take on the look of great distances,
as if she gazed far.</p>
<p>And for exactly three hours each day there
could be heard the monotonous bark-bark-bark
of the big guns Jim Last had given her in his final
hour. To Billy Brent there was something terrible
in this. Bred to violence and the quick disasters
of the country as he was, he could not reconcile
this grim practice with Tharon Last, the sane and
loving girl who could not bear the sight of
suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Curly,&#8221; he complained to his
friend of nights when they came in and lounged in
the soft dusk by the bunk-house, &#8220;it&#8217;s unnatural.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Not that I don&#8217;t pay full respect to Jim Last&#8217;s
memory, an&#8217; him th&#8217; best man in all this hell-bent
Valley, but it ain&#8217;t right an&#8217; natural fer no woman
t&#8217; do what she&#8217;s doin&#8217;. Ain&#8217;t she Jim Last&#8217;s own
daughter already with th&#8217; guns? Sure. Can drive
a nail nigh as far as he could. Quick as Wylackie
Bob on th&#8217; draw an&#8217; as certain, now. Then why
must she keep it up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly, more silent in his ways but given to
thought, studied the stars that rode the darkening
heavens and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her alone,&#8221; he said once, &#8220;it was Last&#8217;s
command, an&#8217; he knew what he was about even
if he was toppin&#8217; th&#8217; rise of the Big Divide.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said &#8216;you&#8217;ll have to pro&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;you rec&#8217;lect?
He meant <i>protect</i> an&#8217; unless I miss my guess, Billy,
he&#8217;d have added &#8216;<i>yourself</i>&#8217; if th&#8217; hand of Ol&#8217;
Man Death hadn&#8217;t stopped his words. Somethin&#8217;
happened out there in th&#8217; Cup Rim that day when
Last got his that had to do with Tharon, an&#8217; he
knew she&#8217;d be in danger. Let her alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Billy let her alone, as did the rest. She
went her ways, saw to the garden and made the
butter in the cool springhouse, and sat in the
window seat in the twilights. She liked to have
the men come in as usual, but the talk these times
was desultory, failing and brightening with forced
topics, to fail again and drop into silence while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the dim red lights of the smokers glowed in the
shadows.</p>
<p>Time and again she stirred and sighed, and they
knew that once again she waited for Jim Last,
listened for the clip-clap of El Rey coming home
along the sounding ranges.</p>
<p>Once, on a night when there was no moon and
the tree-toads sang in the cottonwoods by the
spring, the girl, sitting so in the familiar window,
suddenly dropped her head on her knees and
sobbed sharply in the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never again!&#8221; she said thickly from the
folds of her denim skirt, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never see him
comin&#8217; home again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The riders stirred. Sympathy ached in their
hearts, but not a man had speech to comfort her.
It was Billy, the impulsive, who reached a hand
to her shoulder and gripped it hard. Tharon
reached up and touched the hand in gratitude.</p>
<p>It was about this time, when the master of
Last&#8217;s Holding had lain a month beneath the
staring mound under the pine tree out to the east
where they had buried Harkness, that Jos&eacute; finished
a work of art. For many days he had
laboured secretly in a calf-shed out behind the
small corrals, and in his slim dark fingers there was
beauty unleashed. Finest carving he knew, since
his forbears, peons across the Border, had spent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
their lives upon the beams of the Missions. None
had taught Jos&eacute;. It was in his blood. Therefore,
from a block of the hard grey stone of the region,
which was almost like granite, he fashioned a
cross, as tall as Tharon herself, struck it out freehand
and true, and set upon its austere face fine
tracery of vines and Jim Last&#8217;s name. He took
into the secret Billy and Curly, since these two he
was sure of, and together they hauled the huge
thing out and set it up.</p>
<p>When Tharon, looking to the east with dawn,
as was her habit, beheld this silent tribute to the
man she had so loved, she leaned her forehead
against the deep window-case and wept from the
depths.</p>
<p>Then she went out to see it and with a knife
she set her own mark thereon&ndash;&ndash;a tiny cross
scratched in the headpiece, another in the arm that
stretched toward all that was mortal of poor
Harkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two,&#8221; she said, dry-eyed, while the glorious
dawn shot up to bathe the world in glory, &#8220;full
pay for you both.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>El Rey, stamping in his own corral, lifted his
beautiful head, scanned the wide reaches that
spread away in living green, and tossing up his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
muzzle, sent out on the silence a ringing call. He
cocked his silver ears and listened. No clear-cut
human whistle answered him. Once more he
called and listened.</p>
<p>Then he lowered his head and stepped along the
fence. His great body, shining like blue satin with
a silver frost upon it, gave and lifted with every
step. The pastern joints above his striped hoofs
were resilient as pliant springs. The muscles
rippled in his shoulders, the blue-white cascade
of his silver tail flowed to his heels, his mane was
like a cloud upon the arch of his neck. He was
strength and beauty incarnate, a monster machine
of living might.</p>
<p>Unrest was upon him. Life had become stagnant,
a tasteless thing. He was keen for the open
stretches, honing to be gone down the wind. He
fretted and ate out his heart for the freedom of
the range. Old Anita, passing at some work or
other, stopped and gazed at him for a compassionate
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, <i>grande caballo</i>,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is
naught but grief at Last&#8217;s Holding. <i>Tharone
querida</i>&#8221; she called into the house, &#8220;come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon came and stood in the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, Anita?&#8221; she asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;El Rey,&#8221; answered the old woman, &#8220;he calls
and calls and none come to him. He, too, needs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
help, <i>Corazon</i>. Why not take him for a run
along the plain? It will help you both.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time the girl stood, considering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not cared to ride lately, Anita,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;but you are right. El Rey should not be
left to fret.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped back in the house, then came out,
and she had added nothing to her attire save her
daddy&#8217;s belt and guns. Without these she never
left the Holding now.</p>
<p>Bareheaded, slender, she was a thing of beauty,
and there was a quiet command about her which
subdued the great El Rey himself, the proudest
horse in all the Valley, outside of Courtrey&#8217;s Ironwoods,
Bolt and Arrow.</p>
<p>Between these three horses there was much
comment and discussion, though they had never
been tested out together.</p>
<p>She found a bridle on a corral post, a strong
affair of rawhide, heavily ornamented with silver,
its bit a Spanish spade. Without this she could not
hold the stallion, and he was no pet to come at her
caressing call of the double notes.</p>
<p>Only Jim Last himself had ever tamed El Rey
to do his bidding by word of mouth. The horse
had had one master. He would never have
another.</p>
<p>Even now, when Tharon bridled him and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
opened the big gate, promising him his long-desired
flight, he seemed not to see her, his beautiful
big eyes looked through, beyond her, as if he
sought another. There was some one for whom
he waited, listened.</p>
<p>From a block of wood set in the yard the girl
gathered the rein tight in her hand, balanced a
moment, and leaped up astride the shining back.</p>
<p>With a snort like a pistol shot El Rey flung up
his great head, leaped into the air and was gone.
Around the corner of the adobe house he went,
out across the trampled yard, and away along the
open to the south, running level and free. With
the first sink-and-lift Tharon had slipped back a
full span. Now she wound her fingers in the white
cloud of mane that flailed her face and edged up,
inch by inch. When her knees were well up on
the huge shoulders that worked beneath them
powerfully, she gathered the reins, one in each
hand, leaned down along the outstretched neck
and let the great king run. The wind sang by her
ears in a rising whine, the green prairie was a
flowing sea beneath her, the thunder of the pounding
hoofs was stupendous music. Tharon shut
her eyes and rode, and for the first time since
Jim Last&#8217;s death a sense of joy rose in her like
a tide.</p>
<p>She had ridden El Rey before, many times. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
had felt him sail beneath her down the open prairies
and always it was so, as if the earth slid by,
as if the note of the wind lifted minute by minute.
She had wondered often about this&ndash;&ndash;how long it
would continue to rise with El Rey&#8217;s rising speed,
how long before he would reach a maximum above
which he could not go, a place where the singing
note would remain fixed.</p>
<p>She had never known him reach that point.
Always he could go faster. Always he had
reserves.</p>
<p>Far out ahead she saw a bunch of cattle feeding.
They were lazily circling in a wide arc, content
under the beaming sun. Near them sat a rider on
a buckskin horse, Bent Smith on Golden. This
Golden was one of the prides of Last&#8217;s Holding.
Bigger than Drumfire or Redbuck, he ranked next
to El Rey himself in speed, for his slim legs,
slapped smartly with the distinguishing finger
marks on the outside of the knee, were long and
shapely, his back short-coupled and strong, his
withers low, his narrow hips high. Tharon bore
hard on El Rey&#8217;s bit, leaned her body to the left,
and they swung in toward Bent and Golden in a
beautiful sweeping curve that brought the cowboy
up in his stirrups with his hat a-wave above
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good girl!&#8221; he yelled with leaping gladness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
as the superb pair shot by. &#8220;Good girl! Go to
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon loosed a hand long enough to wave
back and was gone, on down the sloping land toward
the country of the Black Coulee, her dark
skirts fluttering at her knees, the two heavy guns
pounding her thighs at every jump.</p>
<p>It was a long time before El Rey came down
from his sweeping flight.</p>
<p>He had been too long holden in cramping bars.
The free winds and the rolling earth filled him
with a sort of madness. He ran with joy and the
surety of unbounded power.</p>
<p>The rider, left far behind, watched them anxiously
for a time, thought of following, glanced at
his cattle, remembered the gun man&#8217;s heritage and
turned to his business.</p>
<p>The sun was well down over the western Rockface
when Tharon and El Rey came back to Last&#8217;s
Holding. The riders were bringing in the cattle,
dust was rising in clouds above the moving masses.
From the ranch house came the savory smells of
cooking.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center; width: 383px;'>
NEAR THEM SAT A RIDER ON A BUCKSKIN HORSE<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The stallion was limber as a willow. He tossed
his handsome head and his eyes were bright as
stars set in his silver face. Life was at high tide
in him, flowing magnificently. Tharon, her cheeks
whipped into pulsing colour by the wind and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
bounding speed, her tawny mane loosed from its
bands and flying in a cloud behind her, smoothed
back from her face, looked wild as an Indian. As
she drew up and sat watching the work of the
evening, she smiled for the first time in many days,
and Jack Masters, passing, felt his heart leap with
gladness.</p>
<p>When the mistress of Last&#8217;s was sad, so were
her people.</p>
<p>When the last big corral gate had swung to and
the boys turned in to unsaddle, she touched El Rey
with a toe and went over among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Line up the horses, boys,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I want
to see them all together once more. Somethin&#8217;
came back in me today&ndash;&ndash;somethin&#8217; I been missing
for a long time. I&#8217;ll be myself again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy turned Redbuck to face her, dropped his
rein. Curly rode up on Drumfire. These two
were red roans, dead matches. Bent brought
Golden and stood him alongside. From far at
the back of the corral they called Conford and
Jack, who came wondering, the former on Sweetheart,
true sister of El Rey, almost as big, almost
as fast, almost as beautiful.</p>
<p>Silver-blue roan, silver-pointed, slim, graceful,
springy, she had not a single dark spot on her
except the sharp black bars of the finger marks
outside her knees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You darlin&#8217;!&#8221; said Tharon as she wheeled in
line.</p>
<p>Then came Jack on Westwind, and he was another
buckskin, paler than Golden, most marvelously
pointed in pure chestnut brown. His finger
marks were brown instead of black&ndash;&ndash;the only
horse at the Holding so distinguished, for no matter
of what shade or colour, in all the others these
peculiar marks were jet black. Five splendid
creatures they stood and pounded the ringing
earth, tossed their heads and waited, though
they had all been far that day and it was feeding
time.</p>
<p>Out in the horse corrals there were many more
of their breed, slim, wiry horses, toughened and
hardened by long hours and daily work, but these
were the flower of Last&#8217;s, the prized favourites.</p>
<p>For a long time Tharon sat and watched them,
noting their perfect condition, their glistening
skins, their shining hoofs, many of which were
striped, another characteristic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;that there&#8217;s
a bunch of horses in Lost Valley to come nigh &#8217;em.
Ironwoods or anything else&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d back th&#8217; Finger
Marks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would we,&#8221; said Conford quietly, &#8220;though
we&#8217;ve seen th&#8217; Ironwoods run&ndash;&ndash;a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s th&#8217; word, Burt,&#8221; said Curly, &#8220;a little.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Who of us has ever seen Courtrey let Bolt run
like he wanted to? Not a darned one. I&#8217;ve seen
that big bay devil pull till th&#8217; blood dripped from
his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; put in Masters, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen that, too&ndash;&ndash;but
I was lyin&#8217; up on th&#8217; Cup Rim oncet, watchin&#8217;
a couple mavericks fer funny work, an&#8217; Courtrey
an&#8217; Wylackie Bob come along down that way on
Bolt an&#8217; Arrow&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; they wasn&#8217;t a-holdin&#8217; them
then. Lord, Lord, how they was goin&#8217;! Two
long red streaks as level as your hand, an&#8217; I swear
my heart came up in my throat to see &#8217;em, an&#8217; I
almost hollered. It was pretty work&ndash;&ndash;pretty
work, an&#8217; no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon looked over at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast as El Rey, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who could tell?&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I know it
was some speed, an&#8217; that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl struck a hand on the king&#8217;s shoulder
so passionately that he jumped and snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; she said tensely, &#8220;El Rey will run
th&#8217; Ironwoods off their feet&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll run th&#8217; heart
out of their master, damn him! Put th&#8217; horses out.
It&#8217;s supper time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw her right limb over the stallion&#8217;s
neck swiftly and with lithe grace, and slid abruptly
to the ground.</p>
<p>As she did so there came the sound of hoofs on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the hard earth at the corner of the house, and a
stranger came sharply into sight.</p>
<p>He drew up and nodded. Conford, just turning
away, turned quickly back and came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The man, tall, lean, dark, returned the salute
with another nod.</p>
<p>He was covered with dust, as if he had ridden
far and been a long time coming. His clothes
were much the worse for wear, but they were
mostly leather, which takes wear standing, as it
were. The wide hat pulled low over his piercing
dark eyes, was ornamented with a vanity of silver.</p>
<p>The riding cuffs at his wrists were studded profusely
with the same metal, as was the wide belt
that spanned his narrow waist.</p>
<p>He wore a three days&#8217; beard, and a black moustache
dropped its long points to the edge of his
jaw. Black hair showed beneath the hat. He
was a remarkable figure, even in Lost Valley, and
he commanded attention.</p>
<p>He carried the customary two guns of the
country, and he bestrode a horse that was as
noticeable as himself.</p>
<p>This horse was no denizen of Lost Valley. It
was an utter alien. Its colour was a dingy black,
as if it had recently been through fire, its coat
rough and unkempt. Its long head was heavy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
slug-like, its nose of the type known among horsemen
as Roman. It was roughly built, raw-boned
and angular, and of so stupendous a size that the
man atop, who was six foot tall himself, seemed
small by comparison.</p>
<p>However, for all its ugliness, it possessed a
seeming of vast power, a suggestion of great
strength.</p>
<p>The stranger looked the group over with his
keen, hard eyes, and spoke in a slow drawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a-ridin&#8217; th&#8217; wrong
trail. I hain&#8217;t expected hyar.&#8221;</p>
<p>And turning abruptly, without another word, he
jogged away around the house and started down
the long slope already greying with the coming
night.</p>
<p>The foreman and the five punchers clamped
over to the corner of the kitchen and watched
him in speculative silence. Tharon came along
and stood by Billy, her hand on the boy&#8217;s arm.
To Billy that sober touch confused the distances,
set the strange rider dancing on the slope.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said Conford, his grey eyes narrow,
&#8220;come from far an&#8217;s goin&#8217; somewheres. I&#8217;ll
watch that duck. He looks like he&#8217;s a record man
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>At supper there was much speculation about the
stranger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay a month&#8217;s pay he come from Texas,&#8221;
said Billy, casting a side glance at his pal Curly,
&#8220;them long lankys usually do. An&#8217; somehow it
shows in their eyes, sort o&#8217; fierce an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; said Tharon severely, &#8220;if I was Curly
I&#8217;d take a fall out of you. He can do it, <i>you</i> know
that an&#8217; <i>I</i> know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Miss Tharon,&#8221; said Curly in his soft
Southern drawl, &#8220;if you feel that-a-way about it,
w&#8217;y, I don&#8217;t care what <i>no</i> little yellow-headed
whipper-snapper from up Wyomin&#8217; way says to th&#8217;
contrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy was a bit abashed, but he stubbornly supported
his contention that the stranger was a
bad-man from Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty bad-men right here in Lost Valley,&#8221;
said the girl quietly, &#8220;an&#8217; th&#8217; breed ain&#8217;t dyin&#8217;
out as I can see. Th&#8217; settlers need a new
leader&ndash;&ndash;now that Jim Last&#8217;s gone.&#8221; And she
fell to playing absently with her fork upon the
cloth.</p>
<p>The boys changed the subject hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found a dead brandin&#8217; fire in th&#8217; Cup Rim
yesterday, Burt,&#8221; said Masters, &#8220;quite a scrabbled
space around it. Looked like some one&#8217;d
branded several calves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; said the foreman. &#8220;Careful
as we are there&#8217;s always likely to be stragglers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
An&#8217; to be a straggler&#8217;s to be a goner in this man&#8217;s
land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he belongs t&#8217; Last&#8217;s,&#8221; said the irrepressible
Billy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay that fer every calf branded
by Courtrey&#8217;s gang we&#8217;ll get back two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; said Tharon again, &#8220;Jim Last wasn&#8217;t
a thief. Neither will his people be thieves. For
every calf branded by Courtrey, <i>one calf</i> wearin&#8217;
th&#8217; J. L.&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; one calf only. We don&#8217;t steal, but
we won&#8217;t lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your boots an&#8217; spurs throwed in, we
won&#8217;t,&#8221; said the boy fervently.</p>
<p>As they rose from the table with all the racket
of out-door men there came once more the sound
of a horse&#8217;s hoofs on the hard earth outside.</p>
<p>Last&#8217;s Holding was a vast sounding-board. No
one on horseback could come near without advertising
his arrival far ahead.</p>
<p>This time it was no stranger. Tharon went to
the western door to bid him &#8217;light.</p>
<p>It was John Dement from down at the Rolling
Cove. He was a thin, worn man, who looked
ten years beyond his forty, his face wrinkled
by the constant fret and worry of the constant
loser.</p>
<p>Tonight he was strung up like a wire. His
voice shook when he returned the hearty greetings
that met him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;an&#8217; Tharon&ndash;&ndash;I
come t&#8217; tell ye all good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye! John, what you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon went forward and put a hand on his
arm. Her blue eyes searched his face.</p>
<p>The man stood by his horse and struck a tragic
fist in a hard palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I give up. I&#8217;m done. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
down the wall come day&ndash;&ndash;me an&#8217; my woman an&#8217;
th&#8217; two boys. Got our duffle ready packed, an&#8217;
Lord knows, it ain&#8217;t enough t&#8217; heft th&#8217; horses.
After five year!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the sound of the hopeless tears of
masculine failure in the man&#8217;s tragic voice. His
fingers twisted his flabby hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up,&#8221; said Conford, pushing nearer,
&#8220;straighten out a bit, Dement. Now, tell us
what&#8217;s up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; last head&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; last hoof&ndash;&ndash;run off last
night as we was comin&#8217; in with &#8217;em a leetle mite
late. Had ben up Black Coulee way, an&#8217; it got
dark on us. Just as we got abreast o&#8217; th&#8217; mouth
of th&#8217; Coulee, where th&#8217; poplars grow, three men
come a-boilin&#8217; out. They was on fast horses&ndash;&ndash;o&#8217;
course&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; right into th&#8217; bunch they went, hell-bent.
Stampeded the hull lot. You know my
bunch&#8217;d got down t&#8217; about a hundred head&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
know what I ben a-hangin&#8217; on fer, only a man hates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
t&#8217; give up an&#8217; own hisself beat out. An&#8217; my
woman&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s a fighter.</p>
<p>&#8220;She kep&#8217; standin&#8217; at my back like, oh, like&ndash;&ndash;well,
she kep&#8217; a-sayin&#8217; &#8216;We&#8217;ll win out yet, John,
you see. Right&#8217;ll win ev&#8217;ry time.&#8217; You see we
are just ready to get th&#8217; patent on our land. She
couldn&#8217;t give that up, seems like. All this time
gone an&#8217; nothin&#8217; gained. So we ben a-hangin&#8217; on
when things went from bad to worse. Th&#8217; herd&#8217;s
been a-goin&#8217; down an&#8217; down. Calves with their
tongues slit so&#8217;s they&#8217;d lose their mothers&ndash;&ndash;fed
up in some coulee by hand an&#8217; branded. Knowed
&#8217;em by my own colour cattle, w&#8217;ich I drove in here
five year ago&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; yellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mothers killed outright an&#8217; th&#8217; calves
branded. Oh, I know it all&ndash;&ndash;but what could I
do? Kep&#8217; gettin&#8217; poorer an&#8217; poorer. Couldn&#8217;t
afford enough riders t&#8217; protect &#8217;em. Then
couldn&#8217;t afford any an&#8217; tried t&#8217; make it go as th&#8217;
boys got older. Courtrey, damn him, wants me
offen that piece o&#8217; land a-fore th&#8217; patent&#8217;s granted.
Him with his twenty thousan&#8217; acres of Lost Valley
now! An&#8217; how&#8217;d he get it? False entry, that&#8217;s
what! How many men&#8217;s come in here, took up
land, &#8216;sold out&#8217; to Courtrey an&#8217; went? Or didn&#8217;t
go. A lot of &#8217;em <i>didn&#8217;t go</i>. We all know that.
An&#8217; who dares to speak in a whisper about it? Th&#8217;
men that did wouldn&#8217;t go&ndash;&ndash;never&ndash;&ndash;nowheres.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>There was the bitterness of utter defeat and
hatred in the shaking voice. The tree-toads, beginning
their nightly chorus from the wet places
below the cottonwoods, emphasized the dreariness
of the recital, the ancient hopelessness of the
weak beneath the heel of the oppressor.</p>
<p>Dement ceased speaking and stood in silhouette
against the last yellow-and-black of the dead
sunset. The protruding apple in his hawk-like
throat worked up and down grotesquely.</p>
<p>For a long moment there was utter silence.</p>
<p>Then he began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed I wasn&#8217;t welcome in th&#8217; Valley
when I hadn&#8217;t ben here more&#8217;n six months. Th&#8217;
first leetle string o&#8217; fence I put up fer corrals
went down, mysterious, as fast as I could fix it.
Th&#8217; woman&#8217;s garden was broke open an&#8217; trampled
to dust by cattle, drove in. Winter ketched us
with mighty leetle t&#8217; eat in th&#8217; way o&#8217; truck. Next
year she guarded it herself some nights, sleepin&#8217;
by day, an&#8217; oncet she took a shot at some one that
come prowlin&#8217; around. They let her fence alone
after that, but what&#8217;d they do outside? Killed all
th&#8217; hogs we had one night an&#8217; piled &#8217;em in a heap
in th&#8217; front door yard! That was hint enough,
but I kep&#8217; a-thinkin&#8217; that ef we behaved decent
like, an&#8217; minded our own business we sartainly
must win out. We did,&#8221; he added grimly after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
little pause, &#8220;like hell. An&#8217; how many others of
th&#8217; settlers has gone through th&#8217; like? We ain&#8217;t
no tin gods ourselves, I own, but we got t&#8217; fight
fire with fire. Only I ain&#8217;t got no more light-wood,&#8221;
he finished quaintly, &#8220;I got to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another silence while the tree-toads
sang. Then the man held out his hand, hardened
and warped with the unceasing toil of those tragic
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Tharon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wisht Jim
Last was here. With him gone Lost Valley&#8217;s in
Courtrey&#8217;s hand an&#8217; no mistake. He was th&#8217; only
man dared face him an&#8217; hold his own. Last&#8217;s
was th&#8217; only head th&#8217; weaker faction had, its
master their only leader. While he lived we had
some show, us leetle fellers. Now there ain&#8217;t no
leader. Th&#8217; ranchers&#8217;ll go out fast now. It&#8217;ll
be a one-man valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the soft darkness Tharon took the extended
hand, held it a moment and laid her other one
upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Dement,&#8221; she quietly said, &#8220;I want
you to go home an&#8217; bar your house for fight. Fix
up your fences, unpack your duffle. In the morning
my riders will drive down to your place a
hundred head o&#8217; cattle. You put your brand on
em. There&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be no one-man doin&#8217;s in
Lost Valley yet awhile&ndash;&ndash;not while Jim Last&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
daughter lives. See,&#8221; she dropped his hand and
pointed to the east where the tall pine lifted to the
stars, &#8220;out yonder there&#8217;s a cross at Jim Last&#8217;s
grave&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; there&#8217;s my mark on it. Th&#8217; settlers
have a leader still&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I name myself that leader.
I&#8217;m set against Courtrey, now an&#8217; forever. I
mean to fight him t&#8217; th&#8217; last inch o&#8217; ground in Lost
Valley, th&#8217; last word o&#8217; law, th&#8217; last drop o&#8217; blood,
both his an&#8217; mine. You go down among &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217;
settlers&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; take &#8217;em that word from me. Tell
&#8217;em Jim Last&#8217;s daughter stands facin&#8217; Courtrey,
an&#8217; she&#8217;ll need at her back t&#8217; fight him every man
in Lost Valley that ain&#8217;t a coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the settler had gone, incoherent and half-incredulous,
Conford drew a long breath and
looked at his mistress in the dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon, dear,&#8221; he said so gently that his
words were like a caress &#8220;you&#8217;re jest a-breakin&#8217;
your riders&#8217; hearts. You&#8217;re heapin&#8217; anxiety on
us mountain-high. Now what on earth&#8217;ll we
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Billy Brent pushed near and slapped a
hand against a doubled fist. His eyes were sparkling
like harbour lights, his voice was like the
sound of running fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Do? We&#8217;ll stand behind
her so tight they can&#8217;t see daylight through, an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll fight with an&#8217; for her every inch o&#8217; that way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
every word o&#8217; that law, every drop o&#8217; that blood!
Who says Last&#8217;s ain&#8217;t on th&#8217; map in Lost Valley?&#8221;
Tharon smiled and touched him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;you&#8217;re after my own
heart. Now get to bed. I want t&#8217; think.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE MAN IN UNIFORM</h3>
</div>
<p>Spring was warming swiftly into summer.
Where the gently sloping ranges went up in
waves and swells toward the uplands at the
east, the bright new green had turned to a darker
shade. The tiny purple and white flowers had
disappeared to give place to sturdier ones of crimson
and gold. The veil of water that fell sharply
down the face of the Wall for a thousand feet at
the Valley&#8217;s southern end had thinned to sheerest
gauze. In the Ca&ntilde;on Country the snow had disappeared
from most of the high points. Red,
black, yellow, the great face of the encircling Wall
stood in everlasting majesty, looking down
upon the level cup of Lost Valley. The unspeakable
upheaval of peaks and crags, of ca&ntilde;ons and
splits and unfathomable depths, was almost a
sealed book to the denizens of the Valley. There
were those who knew False Ridge.</p>
<p>There were those who said they knew more.
Many a man had adventured therein, and few
had returned to tell of their adventures. Ca&ntilde;on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Jim had not returned. Not that he was a loss
to the community, or that they mourned him, but
his absence pointed again to the formidable secretive
power of the Ca&ntilde;on Country.</p>
<p>Tharon Last, standing in her western door,
could look across the Valley&#8217;s deceptive miles and
see the huge black seams and fissures that rent the
grim face. These splits and ca&ntilde;ons were peculiar
in that none came down to the Valley&#8217;s floor, their
yawning doorways being, in every instance, set
from two hundred to five hundred feet up the
Wall.</p>
<p>Often the girl watched them in the changing
lights and her active mind formed many a conjecture
concerning them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; she told young Paula, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
into the Ca&ntilde;on Country and see it for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saints forbid, Se&ntilde;orita!&#8221; said Paula, who had
no love for the mysterious, and who was more
Mexic than Porno, &#8220;there are demons and devils
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I doubt not, Paula,&#8221; said Tharon
grimly. &#8220;They say Courtrey knows th&#8217; Ca&ntilde;ons,
an&#8217; when he&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s peopled, an&#8217; no mistake!</p>
<p>&#8220;But it must be beautiful&ndash;&ndash;beautiful! Why&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
a thousand feet of crevasse on every hand,
I know, steps an&#8217; benches an&#8217; weathered faces that
no man can climb. They say there&#8217;s bright waters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
that tumble down like th&#8217; Vestal&#8217;s Veil and sink
into holes without an outlet. Just go away in the
rock. There&#8217;s strange flowers an&#8217; stunted trees.
An&#8217; they tell of th&#8217; Cup of God, a hidden glade
so beautiful that th&#8217; eye of man has never seen
its like. All my life it&#8217;s called me, th&#8217; Ca&ntilde;on
Country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe, Paula, that there&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
there for me? Some reason why I know I
must some day go into its heart an&#8217; give myself up
to it for a time? If I was free,&#8221; she finished with
a sigh, &#8220;if I was my own woman, wholly, I&#8217;d go
soon. There&#8217;s rest an&#8217; peace up there, I know&ndash;&ndash;and
a place to think of Jim Last without such bitterness
that my heart turns t&#8217; gall.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her bright head against the doorpost
and shut her soft lips into a straight line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; she finished sadly, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t my own
woman yet.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Tharon,&#8221; said Billy Brent this day, clanking
around the corner of the adobe house, his leather
chaps flapping with every step, his yellow hair
curling boyishly under his hat-brim. &#8220;Tharon, I
got bad news for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was genuine distress in his grey eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked the mistress of Last&#8217;s, straightening
up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, an&#8217; I hate like hell t&#8217; tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it, Billy. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s dynamited th&#8217; Crystal Spring in
th&#8217; Cup Rim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The word was in italics. Its one syllable told
all one might care to know of the importance of
Billy&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Opened her up fer two square yards.
Spread th&#8217; lovely old Crystal all over th&#8217; range.
An&#8217; she&#8217;s gone, as sure&#8217;s shootin&#8217;. Nothin&#8217; but a
lot o&#8217; wet an&#8217; dryin&#8217; mud to show for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtrey&#8217;s beginnin&#8217;,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s heard
th&#8217; word I sent th&#8217; settlers. He&#8217;s goin&#8217; t&#8217; use th&#8217;
tactics now with Last&#8217;s that he&#8217;s used with every
poor devil he wanted to run out of th&#8217; Valley, th&#8217;
tactics he darsent use while Jim Last lived. Well&ndash;&ndash;go
send Conford to me, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sat down in the doorway and gazed
sombrely out over the summer land.</p>
<p>When her foreman came and stood before her,
a slim, efficient figure, dark-faced and quiet, she
had already made up her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burt,&#8221; she said swiftly, &#8220;drive th&#8217; cattle
down from th&#8217; Cup Rim right away. We&#8217;ll run
those two bunches under Blue Pine an&#8217; Nick Bob
out toward th&#8217; Black Coulee. Tell &#8217;em t&#8217; keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
close t&#8217; th&#8217; others. I trust th&#8217; Indians, but there
ain&#8217;t no Indian livin&#8217; can meet Courtrey&#8217;s white
renegades in courage an&#8217; wits. Then we&#8217;ll start
right in an&#8217; dig a well th&#8217; first well ever dug
on th&#8217; open range in this man&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, Tharon!&#8221; said Conford, &#8220;A
well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Th&#8217; livin&#8217; water holes have been th&#8217;
pride of th&#8217; Valley, I know, but we&#8217;ll fix this well
of ours so&#8217;s even Courtrey will respect it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a grim note in the golden voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Conford uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dig it first,&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;then I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the mistress said, went. Therefore, the
next morning saw a disgusted bunch of cowboys
and Indian <i>vaqueros</i> setting to with a will at a
spot much nearer the Holding than the Crystal
had been, and it took a much shorter time to reach
water in a good gravel bed than any one had
dreamed.</p>
<p>In three days the thing was done and Conford
presented himself, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Secrecy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come on with
th&#8217; mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon went in to the big desk which Jim Last
had used and which was now her own, and returned
with a square white slab of pine, elaborately
smoothed and finished by Jos&eacute;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Read that,&#8221; she said, and held it up, face
out.</p>
<p>Printed neatly upon its shining surface, in the
jet-black ink that old Anita made from the berries
of a certain bush which grew at the foot of the
cliffs across the Valley, were these words:</p>
<p>&#8220;This well is planted. I hope it blows up the
first thief who tries to destroy it. Tharon Last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conford took the slab, scratched his head, holding
his hat between thumb and finger, read it over,
read it again, smiled, and then looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might work,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;re givin&#8217; out
your stand an&#8217; knowledge broadcast, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly am,&#8221; said Tharon briefly. &#8220;I said
I&#8217;d fight, an&#8217; I want th&#8217; whole Valley t&#8217; know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; said Conford with conviction. &#8220;I
heard in Corvan yesterday that John Dement has
rode th&#8217; range continuous since he finished brandin&#8217;
his new herd to tell th&#8217; settlers about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be better.
There&#8217;s got to be a change in Lost Valley sooner
or later. Might as well be sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that thought the girl let her quick
mind sweep out to take in the future. She sent
Conford off to post her placard and herself went
rummaging among the possibilities which her defy
had placed before her. She knew that Courtrey
would be coldly furious. He had lived his life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
as suited him, had taken what and where he listed,
by fair means or foul, and though every soul in
the Valley knew him and his methods, none had
spoken the convicting word. It was the pen-stroke
at the end of the death-warrant to do so.</p>
<p>She knew that the faction of the settlers hated
him and his with a vitriolic passion, that they
were in the minority, that they were no tin gods
themselves, and that they were being beaten out,
one by one.</p>
<p>Year by year Courtrey had added to his vast
acreage, and it was a matter of common knowledge
how he had done it. He was rich, powerful,
bullying, a man whose self-aggrandizement knew
no limit, whose merest whim was his law, whose
will must not be thwarted. Year by year his
<i>vaqueros</i> drove down the Wall herds of fat cattle,
their brands blurred, insolently raw and careless.
Many a hapless man had stood and seen his
own stock go by in Courtrey&#8217;s band and dared
not open his mouth. In fact Courtrey had been
known to stop and chat with such a one, smiling
his evil smile and enjoying the helpless chagrin
of his victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insolent ruffian!&#8221; muttered Tharon this day,
frowning above her daddy&#8217;s pipes on the desk
top. &#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; t&#8217; get one run for his money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
from now till one of us is whipped. It may be
me, but I&#8217;ll leave my mark on him, so help me!</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight killin&#8217;s too good for him. I want
to smash him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon, mi <i>Corazon</i>,&#8221; said Anita, stopping
soft-foot beside her, &#8220;it is bad for one to talk
so, to himself. The Evil One works on the mind
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Anita,&#8221; she said shortly, &#8220;it is with
the Evil One I have t&#8217; do, an&#8217; no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman crossed herself and went away,
her wrinkled face dim with care. And Tharon
dressed herself neatly, put a ribbon on her hair,
set her wide hat carefully on her head, buckled
on her heavy gun-belt, and went to the corral for
El Rey. Her daddy&#8217;s saddle was her own now, a
huge affair carved and ornamented, profusely
studded with silver.</p>
<p>Along the right side below the pommel ran a
darker stain, Jim Last&#8217;s blood, set before his
daughter like a star.</p>
<p>She mounted the silver stallion and went away
down along the summer land, a shaft of light
shooting through the green of the ranges.</p>
<p>Far over to her left she could see her cattle,
beautiful bunches spread like figures in a tapestry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
The figures of her riders were small dots on the
outskirts.</p>
<p>El Rey, always hard on the bit, always strong-headed,
wanted to run and she swung loose her
rein and let him go. But run as he might, there
was always in his speed that rising note, that
seeming of reserve power.</p>
<p>She passed the head of Black Coulee, swung
out across the edge of Rolling Cove, thundered
down to the ford of the Broken Bend. Here she
let the stallion drink, deep draughts that would
have slowed a lesser horse. El Rey went up the
bank beyond the ford like a charging engine,
squared away and stretched out to finish his run.
He was within three miles of Corvan, set like a
stone in a smooth green surface, before he came
down and lifted his shoulders into his gait. With
the first rock and swing of the singlefoot, Tharon
smiled and settled herself more comfortably in
the saddle. This was joy to her, this beautiful
syncopation, this poetic marked time that reeled
off the miles beneath her and would scarcely have
shaken a pebble from her hat-brim.</p>
<p>As she struck the outskirts of the little town
the unmistakable sound of El Rey&#8217;s iron-shod
hoofs brought heads into doors, children at the
house corners to look upon her. She came down
the main street at a smart clip, to bring up with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
a slide at the hitch-rail before Baston&#8217;s store
where the monthly mail was handled. There were
horses tied there, and among them she saw what
caused her to look twice with a narrowing of her
keen eyes&ndash;&ndash;a huge, raw-boned, black, rusty and
slug-headed, among the Ironwood bays from
Courtrey&#8217;s Stronghold.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; she told herself quietly, &#8220;so there&#8217;s
where he was expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tied El Rey to himself, far from the rest,
for she knew his imperious temper and that trouble
would ensue if he was near strange horses.</p>
<p>Then she went into Baston&#8217;s with her meal-sack
on her arm. This meal-sack was a part of her
accoutrement, a regular carry-all for such small
purchases as she must take home&ndash;&ndash;a roll of print
for Paula, some tobacco for the men, a dozen
spools of the linen thread which was so much
prized among the women of Lost Valley.</p>
<p>As she stepped in the open door her quick glance
went over the big room with a comprehensiveness
which catalogued its inmates accurately and instinctively.
Courtrey was not there, though his
great bay, Bolt, stood outside. However, Wylackie
Bob was there. This man, sitting at a canvas
covered table in a corner, idly fingering a pack
of cards, was not one to be passed over easily.
He was notorious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Tall, slow of action, sleepy-eyed, he was treacherous
as a snake, as swift to move when necessary.
He had been known to sit as he was now, idly
playing, to leap up, crouch, draw and kill a man,
and be down again at his place, idly playing, before
the breath was done in his victim.</p>
<p>He was a past-master of his gun, and unlike
most men of the time and place, he carried only
one.</p>
<p>He was a quarter-blood Wylackie Indian. Near
him sat the stranger who had ridden the slug-head
black into Lost Valley. They both looked up as
the girl entered and regarded her with smiles.</p>
<p>Tharon did not look at them again. She saw,
however, that they were together, of one interest.
There were two or three of the settlers
in the store, Jameson from over under the Rockface
at the south, Hill from farther up, Thomas
from Rolling Cove. She spoke to these men
quietly and noticed with an inward thrill the eagerness
with which they responded.</p>
<p>There was an electric something between them
which told her that her promise had, indeed, gone
up and down the country, that in a subtle, unheralded
manner she stood in Jim Last&#8217;s place, a
head, a leader.</p>
<p>She made her purchases without undue speech,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
got two letters in her father&#8217;s name&ndash;&ndash;and these
brought a smarting under her eyelids&ndash;&ndash;tied up
her sack and went out without so much as a
glance at the two men in the corner. Laughter
followed her, however, which set the red blood of
anger pulsing in her cheeks.</p>
<p>At the end of the store porch she came face
to face with Courtrey and Steptoe Service, the
sheriff of Menlo county. She swung to one side to
descend the rough steps, vouchsafing them no
word or look, but Service blocked her way. She
raised her eyes and looked him full in the face,
scanning his coarse red features coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear, Tharon?&#8221; asked Service,
&#8220;about you a-makin&#8217; threats?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you heard?&#8221; she wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, that you&#8217;re a-makin&#8217; threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff flushed darker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, young woman,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he raised his
voice suddenly and on the instant there was a
sound of boots on the store floor and the settlers,
the two men in the corner, Baston and two clerks
came crowding out to hear, &#8220;you look a-here&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
you know it&#8217;s a-gin th&#8217; law for any one t&#8217;
make a threat like you done, open an&#8217; above
board, in th&#8217; Golden Cloud th&#8217; other night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon shifted the meal-sack higher on her
left arm. Courtrey&#8217;s eyes went down to her right
hand and stayed there.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s upper lip lifted from her teeth in a
sneer that was the acme of insult. The fire was
beginning to play in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law?&#8221; she said. &#8220;My God! Law!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>law</i>! you young hussy, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you fergit
that I represent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl threw down the sack and flashed both
hands on the gun-butts. Courtrey, watching, was
half-a-second behind her and stopped with his
hands hovering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, Courtrey,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you fast
gun man! You&#8217;re too slow. An&#8217; this ain&#8217;t your
game, anyway, not face t&#8217; face. You&#8217;re all right
on a dark night&ndash;&ndash;<i>an&#8217; from behind</i>. Fine! But
you&#8217;re a coward. You&#8217;re what I called you before&ndash;&ndash;an
assassin.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pale as ashes, her eyes narrowed to
blazing slits. Jim Last, gun man, was in her like
those composite pictures which show the shadow
in the substance. There was a gasp from the
store porch where Thomas stood with a shaking
hand covering his lips. Baston was stuck against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
his wall like a leech, rigid. These men knew that
she tempted death.</p>
<p>Not a man in Lost Valley could have done it
and gotten away with it.</p>
<p>Tharon knew it, too, but she did not care.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now you know what you are, Courtrey.
I&#8217;ll tell th&#8217; same to you, Step Service. Law! In
Lost Valley? Yes, Courtrey&#8217;s law! Th&#8217; law of
th&#8217; gun alone&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; law of thieves&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; law of
murderers. An&#8217; you stand for that, you bet!
What were you before you took th&#8217; oath of office?
Tell me that! Th&#8217; man who killed old Mike
McCrea an&#8217; took his cattle down th&#8217; Wall! Th&#8217;
whole Valley knows it&ndash;&ndash;but we&#8217;ve never dared to
say it before!&#8221;</p>
<p>The porch was lined with people now. Soft-footed
Indians and Mexican <i>vaqueros</i>, sprung
from nowhere, cowboys, ranchers, women, they
came silently up and listened.</p>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s red face was the colour of liver,
purple and mottled with bursting rage. His fingers
worked at his sides. He set his lips, and his
small eyes never left the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Tharon, crouched a bit, her feet apart, her
elbows crooked above her hips, her fingers curled
on her gun-butts with nice precision, wet her own
pale lips and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; who put you in office? That laugh of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
office! Who? Why, Courtrey&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; biggest thief,
th&#8217; coldest murderer in th&#8217; country! <i>He</i> put you
there! An&#8217; what are you good for? My daddy
was shot&ndash;&ndash;<i>in th&#8217; back</i>&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; did you make one inquiry
into the murder? Come out to Last&#8217;s, even
to find a clew? Not you! There&#8217;s only one sheriff
in this Valley&ndash;&ndash;one bit o&#8217; law that will avenge his
death&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; that&#8217;s <i>me</i>! Now, you two fine gentlemen&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217;. There&#8217;s my hand! I throw th&#8217;
cards on th&#8217; table! Shoot me in the back if you&#8217;ve
got th&#8217; nerve. Come out in th&#8217; open an&#8217; fight!
<i>But you better be quick about it!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she backed slowly along the porch,
keeping them in view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away behind me,&#8221; she called. There was a
path opened instantly, the sound of shuffling feet.
Along the porch she went, step by step, stopping
every moment or so to keep close hold on her
advantage, every nerve strained, every one of her
faculties at the top of its power.</p>
<p>She felt for the step with her foot, went down,
backed through the crowd, brought them all in
the range of the guns which she flashed out now
and held upon them.</p>
<p>She was ashy pale, a flaming, vibrant thing.
Not a man there but knew she was more dangerous
at the moment than cool Jim Last had ever
been, for she radiated hatred of her father&#8217;s killer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
in every bitter glance. She had none for whom to
be cautious. She was the last of her blood. She
was efficient, and she knew it.</p>
<p>Courtrey knew it, and felt the sweat start on
his skin.</p>
<p>Service knew it, and hated her for it.</p>
<p>As the girl backed clear there came into her
vision a strange figure&ndash;&ndash;the straight, trim figure
of a man who stood stiffly at attention, where her
imperious words had caught him.</p>
<p>He wore a uniform of semi-military style,
leather leggings, a flannel shirt of butternut and a
smart, tan, broad-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>He, too, came in the range of the travelling guns
and waited their pleasure.</p>
<p>Tharon reached El Rey. She stuck her right-hand
weapon in its holster, loosed the rein, flung
it over the stallion&#8217;s head, stepped around his
shoulder and mounted deftly and swiftly from the
wrong side. It was a pretty trick of horsemanship
and showed up her adroitness. As El Rey
rose on his hind feet, whirling, that unwavering
muzzle whirled also, to keep in line. The king
struck into his gait and his rider, facing backward,
swung away down the narrow street.
Until she was well out of range the tension
held.</p>
<p>Then Steptoe Service struck a fist into a palm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and began to swear in a fury, but Courtrey
laughed, one of his rare, short bursts of mirth that
were more bodeful than oaths.</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and strode back the way
he had come.</p>
<p>The stranger in the uniform walked forward,
went up the steps, crossed the porch, and, stooping,
picked up the meal-sack which Tharon had
dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will some one kindly tell me who the young
lady is and where she lives?&#8221; he asked gravely.</p>
<p>Baston, unglued from the wall, spoke up with
his usual pompous eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon, from Last&#8217;s Holdin&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; and the man wrapped the sack into
a small bundle and tied it with its own string.</p>
<p>He stuck it under one arm and taking out a
short brown pipe, proceeded to fill and light it.</p>
<p>Courtrey, halted a few rods away, eyed him
sharply.</p>
<p>As he turned, rolling his match to death in his
fingers, the sun struck mellowly upon something
on his breast, a small, dark copper shield which
bore strange heraldry.</p>
<p>At the sight Courtrey&#8217;s eyes sought Service&#8217;s
and held them for a swift, questioning moment.</p>
<p>Strangers in Lost Valley were contraband.</p>
<p>The three settlers looked covertly at each other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
drifted apart, got their horses and presently left
town by different ways.</p>
<p>Three hours later these men met by common
consent at the head of Rolling Cove and talked
long and earnestly of the happening. They knew
that Courtrey would never take silently that bitter
arraignment, that something would transpire
swiftly to show his resentment, to prove his absolute
power over Lost Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t Tharon that&#8217;ll suffer, even ef he did
try t&#8217; shoot her that night in th&#8217; Golden Cloud,
because Courtrey wants her himself,&#8221; said Jameson
quietly, &#8220;th&#8217; whole country knows that. There
was only one man who didn&#8217;t know it, an&#8217; that
was Jim Last himself. No, he won&#8217;t monkey with
th&#8217; Holdin&#8217; yet, not to any great extent. It&#8217;ll be
us little fellers, us others who he knows would
stan&#8217; behind her. Some of us&#8217;ll lose somethin&#8217;
soon, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do,&#8221; said Hill passionately, &#8220;it&#8217;s time t&#8217;
show our hand. We&#8217;ve been hounded long
enough. Th&#8217; men from Last&#8217;s will be with us, we
can gamble on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Thomas, &#8220;but it&#8217;ll be war. Open
war. There&#8217;ll be killin&#8217;s then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jameson, a quiet man with deep eyes, made a
wide gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if there is?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;might&#8217;s well be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
done in th&#8217; open as in th&#8217; dark an&#8217; unseen. Might
better be! I move we ride th&#8217; Valley an&#8217; ask th&#8217;
settlers to band together, under Last&#8217;s, an&#8217; give
our ultimatum t&#8217; Courtrey on th&#8217; heels of this.
What say you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say yes,&#8221; said Hill swiftly. Thomas, of less
stern stuff, wavered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s wait awhile. Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t be too
quick. Courtrey now, he&#8217;s mighty quick an&#8217; hot.
They ain&#8217;t no tellin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jameson promptly, &#8220;suit
yourself&ndash;&ndash;we ain&#8217;t a-pressin&#8217; no man into this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, now, I&#8217;m fer it, boys&ndash;&ndash;that is, I&#8217;m believin&#8217;
it&#8217;s got t&#8217; be done, only I counsels time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No time,&#8221; cried Hill, &#8220;we ben counselin&#8217;
time an&#8217; quiet an&#8217; not doin&#8217; anything to stir &#8217;em
up, an&#8217; what d&#8217; we get? Cattle stole every spring,
waterholes taken an&#8217; fenced fer Courtrey&#8217;s stock
right on th&#8217; open range, hogs drove off, fences tore
down, like pore old John Dement&#8217;s an&#8217; some of
us left t&#8217; rot every year in some coulee. We
done waited a sight too long. Courtrey thinks he
owns Lost Valley, an&#8217; he comes near doin&#8217; it,
what with his hired killers, Wylackie an&#8217; Black
Bart an&#8217; this new gun man that&#8217;s just come in. I
heered today he&#8217;s from Arizona, an&#8217; imported
article.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jameson turned to him and held out his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ride tomorrow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hill grasped the extended hand and looked hard
in the other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thomas, still of the timid, doubting heart,
watched them with a hand over his mouth to hide
its shaking.</p>
<p>Without a word the others turned their horses
and rode away in different directions. As they
went farther from him in the wash of the late light
the uncertain hand came down with a jerk. Fear
was in his eyes, the deep, quaking fear of the man
poor in courage, but he beat it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; he cried in a panic, &#8220;don&#8217;t leave me
out! For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t think I ain&#8217;t willin&#8217;!
I&#8217;ll be out come day tomorrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>The others both stopped and turned in their
saddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear ye come through, Thomas,&#8221;
called Jameson, &#8220;you ride south along th&#8217; Rockface.
You&#8217;ll go over Black Coulee way, won&#8217;t
ye, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll go north.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quiet grimness in the few words,
for he who rode north on such an errand tempted
fate.</p>
<p>Then the three separated, and there was only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the silence and the red light of the dying day at
the head of Rolling Cove.</p>
<p>That same evening Tharon Last sat in her
western doorway and watched the sun go down
in majesty over the weathered peaks and ridges of
the Ca&ntilde;on Country.</p>
<p>Billy Brent lounged on the hard earth beside the
step, his fair head shining in the afterglow, his
grey eyes upon the girl&#8217;s face in a sort of idol-worship.</p>
<p>The curve of her cheek, golden with tan and
red with the hue of youth, was more to him than
all the sunsets the world had ever seen.</p>
<p>A deep light shone in his young eyes which, had
the girl been wise, she might have seen. But
Tharon was as elemental as the kitten chasing a
moth out by the pansy bed, and could look in a
man&#8217;s face with the unconscious eyes of a child.</p>
<p>Now she watched the pageant of the dying day
in a rapt delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said presently, &#8220;I&#8217;ve often wondered
if there&#8217;s another place in all the world as
lovely as our Valley. Jim Last told me once that
there were places so much bigger out below, that
we wouldn&#8217;t be a patchin&#8217; to them. Don&#8217;t seem
like there could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her slim body up along the doorpost
and looked long and earnestly all up and down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
wonderful stretch of country that lay along the
Wall from north to south. She could see the tiny
dots that went for the different homesteads, scattered
here and there. Up at the head there lay,
hard against the frowning hills, the squat, wide
blur that was Courtrey&#8217;s Stronghold. Her lips
compressed at sight of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; she said, shaking her head, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe he meant it. He used to tease me a lot,
you know. It&#8217;s an awful big valley, an&#8217; no
mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rider, who had drifted up along the Wall
five years before, looked down at the playing
kitten and smiled with a lean crinkling of his
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sure-enough big place, Tharon,&#8221; he
said gravely, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s lovely as Eden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;where&#8217;s that, Billy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy sobered and looked up into her blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tharon,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;that&#8217;s where
th&#8217; heart is.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she regarded him. Then she
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said severely, &#8220;you&#8217;re stringin&#8217;
your boss. I&#8217;m sure goin&#8217; to fire you, some day,
like I ben a-threatenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; hire me over!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl shut her pretty lips and the man&#8217;s
hand crept softly up and touched her wrist where
it lay against her knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said airily, &#8220;gimme my time.
I quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an odd note in his voice, as if under
the play there was a purpose. For a second
Tharon held her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you mean, Billy?&#8221; she asked so sharply
that the boy jumped.</p>
<p>Then he laughed, still in that light fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I said,&#8221; he affirmed doggedly.</p>
<p>But the mistress of Last&#8217;s took a clutch on his
hand that was authority in force and leaned down
to look anxiously in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Billy,&#8221; she said with a quiver in her
voice, &#8220;Last&#8217;s couldn&#8217;t run without you, boy.
An&#8217; what&#8217;s more, I thought all th&#8217; riders of th&#8217;
Holdin&#8217; would stand by th&#8217; place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy, fully sobered, straightened up and held
hard to that clutching hand. The red light of the
sunset flushed his cheeks, but it never set the glow
that was in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know yet, Tharon,&#8221; he said quietly,
&#8220;when I&#8217;m a-jokin&#8217; with you? I&#8217;d stand by Last&#8217;s
an&#8217; you to my last breath. Don&#8217;t you know
that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>For a long moment Tharon regarded him
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but somehow I don&#8217;t
like to have you talk that-a-way, Billy. Don&#8217;t
do it no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; promised the rider, &#8220;if you say
so, Boss. Only don&#8217;t talk about firin&#8217; me, then.
I&#8217;m very sensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he looked away with smiling eyes to where
the deep black shadows fell prone into the Valley
from the forbidding face of the great Wall.</p>
<p>Only the towering peaks were alight with crimson
and gold, which haloed their bulk in majestic
mystery.</p>
<p>Night was coming fast across Lost Valley, while
the tree-toads out by the springhouse set up their
nightly chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Eden,&#8221; thought the man, &#8220;as sure&#8217;s th&#8217;
world, made an&#8217; forgot with all its trimmin&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;innocence
an&#8217; sweetness an&#8217; plenty, an&#8217; th&#8217; silence
of perfect peace, not to overlook th&#8217; last unnecessary
evil, th&#8217; livin&#8217; presence of his majesty, th&#8217;
devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the light died wholly and there came the
disturbing sound of boots on the ringing stones.
The rest of the riders were coming in to claim
their share of Billy&#8217;s Eden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>UNBROKEN BREAD</h3>
</div>
<p>Jameson, Hill and Thomas were as good as
their word. During the week that followed
the spectacular denouncement of Courtrey
and Service at Baston&#8217;s store, they went quietly to
every settler in the Valley and declared themselves.
In almost every instance they met with eager
pledges of approval. They knew, every man of
them, that this slow banding together for resistance
against Courtrey and his power meant open
war. For years they had suffered indignities and
hardship without protest. While Jim Last lived
they had had a sort of leader, an example, though
they had feared to follow in his lead too strongly.</p>
<p>They had copied his methods of guarding possessions,
of corraling every cattle-brute at night,
of keeping every horse under bars. Last had
looked Courtrey in the face. The rest dared not.</p>
<p>Now with Last gone, they felt the lack, as if a
bastion had been razed, leaving them in the open.
Secrecy in Lost Valley had been brought to a
work of art. They could hold their tongues.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>But with the new knowledge Tharon Last took
on a light, a halo.</p>
<p>Men spoke in whispers about her daring. They
felt it themselves.</p>
<p>Word of her lightning quickness with her daddy&#8217;s
guns, of her accuracy, went softly all about
and about, garbled and accentuated. They said
she could shoot the studs from the sides of a
man&#8217;s belt and never touch him. They said she
could drive a nail farther than the ordinary man
could see. They said she could draw so swiftly
that the motion of the hands was lost.</p>
<p>A slow excitement took the faction of the settlers.</p>
<p>But out at Last&#8217;s Holding a grave anxiety sat
upon Tharon&#8217;s riders. Conford knew&ndash;&ndash;and Billy
knew&ndash;&ndash;and Curly knew more about Courtrey&#8217;s intent
than some of the others. Young Paula, half
asleep in the deep recesses of the house, had witnessed
that furious encounter by the western door
on the soft spring day when Jim Last had come
home to die at dusk. She knew that the look in
Courtrey&#8217;s eyes had been covetousness&ndash;&ndash;and she
had told Jos&eacute;. Jos&eacute;, loyal and sensible, had told
the boys. So now there was always one or more
of them on duty near the mistress of Last&#8217;s on
one pretext or another. To Tharon, who knew
more than all of them put together, this was funny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>It stirred the small mirth there was in her these
days, and often she sent them away, to have them
turn up at the most unexpected times and places.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys!&#8221; she would say whimsically, &#8220;you
think Courtrey&#8217;s goin&#8217; to cart me off livin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we are afraid of, Tharon,&#8221;
answered Conford gravely once, &#8220;we know it&#8217;d
not be <i>livin&#8217;</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Tharon had looked away toward Jos&eacute;&#8217;s
cross, and frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; it won&#8217;t be any way, <i>livin&#8217;</i>
or dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>One night toward the end of that week a strange
cavalcade wound up along the levels, past the head
of Black Coulee, forded the Broken Bend in silence
save for the stroke of hoof and iron shoe on
stone, and went toward Last&#8217;s. There were thirty
men, riding close, and they had nothing to say in
the darkness.</p>
<p>At the Holding Tharon Last waited them on
her western doorstep.</p>
<p>As they rode in along the sounding-board the
muffled ringing of the hoofs seemed to the girl as
the call of clarions. The heart in her breast
leaped with a strange thrill, a gladness. She felt
as if her father&#8217;s spirit stood behind her waiting
the first step toward the fulfillment of her promise.</p>
<p>The riders stopped in the soft darkness. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
was no moon and the very winds seemed to have
hushed their whispers in the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon,&#8221; said the man who rode in the lead,
and she recognized the voice of Jameson from the
southern end of the Valley, &#8220;we&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. A simple declaration, awaiting
her disposal.</p>
<p>Conford, not half approving, his heart heavy
with foreboding, stood at his mistress&#8217; shoulder
and waited, too.</p>
<p>For a long moment there was no sound save the
eternal tree-toads at their concert. Then the girl
spoke, and it seemed to those shadowy listeners
that they heard again the voice of Jim Last, sane,
commanding, full of courage and conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Tharon simply, &#8220;th&#8217; time has
come when Lost Valley has got t&#8217; stand or fall
forever. Courtrey&#8217;s gettin&#8217; stronger every day,
more careless an&#8217; open. He&#8217;s been content to steal
a bunch of cattle here, another there, a little at a
time. Now he&#8217;s takin&#8217; them by th&#8217; herds, like
John Dement&#8217;s last month. He&#8217;s got a wife, an&#8217;
from what I&#8217;ve always heard, she&#8217;s a sight too
good fer him. But he wants more&ndash;&ndash;he wants <i>me</i>.
He&#8217;s offered me th&#8217; last insult, an&#8217; as Jim Last&#8217;s
daughter I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to even up my score with
him, an&#8217; it&#8217;s got three counts. You&#8217;ve all got
scores against him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>Here there were murmurs through the silent
group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; next outrage from Courtrey, on any one
of us, gets all of us together. For every cattle-brute
run off by Courtrey&#8217;s band, we&#8217;ll take back
one in open day, all of us ridin&#8217;. We&#8217;ll have to
shoot, but I&#8217;m ready. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Every man answered on the instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the girl tensely, &#8220;get down an&#8217;
sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rattle of stirrups and bits, a creak
of leather as thirty men swung off their horses.</p>
<p>Tharon stepped back in the lighted room. Her
men stood there against the walls. The settlers
came diffidently in across the sill, lean, poor men
for the most part, their strained eyes and furrowed
faces showing the effect of hardships. Not
a man there but had seen himself despoiled, had
swallowed the bitter dose in helplessness.</p>
<p>Most of them were married and had families.
Some of them had killings to their record. Many
of them were none too upright.</p>
<p>Jameson was a good man, and so was Dan Hill.
Thomas was merely weak. Buford was a gun
man who had protected his own much better than
the rest. McIntyre was like him. One by one
they came forward as Tharon called them by
name, and leaning down, put their names or their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
marks to a sheet of paper which bore these few
simple lines:</p>
<p>&#8220;We, the signers named below, do solemnly
promise and pledge ourselves to stand together,
through all consequences of this act, for the protection
of our lives and property. For every piece
of property taken from any one of us, we shall go
together and take back it, or its worth, from whoever
took it. For every person killed in any way,
but fair-and-open, we promise to hang the murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy had drafted the document. Tharon, whom
Jim Last had taught her letters, read it aloud.
The names of Last&#8217;s Holding headed it. The
thirty names and marks&ndash;&ndash;and of the latter there
were many&ndash;&ndash;stretched to the bottom of the sheet.</p>
<p>When it was done the girl folded it solemnly
and put it away in the depths of the big desk. Old
Anita, watching from the shadows of the eating
room beyond, put her <i>reboso</i> over her head and
rocked in silent grief. She had seen tragic things
before.</p>
<p>Then these lean and quiet men filed out,
mounted the waiting horses and went away in the
darkness, mysterious figures against the stars.</p>
<p>That night Tharon Last sat late by the deep
window in her own room at the south of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
ranch house. It was a huge old room, high walled
and sombre. There were bright blankets hung
like pictures on the walls, baskets marvelously
woven of grass and rushes, thick mats on the floor
made in like manner and of a tough, long-fibred
grass that grew down in a swale beyond the
Black Coulee, while in one corner there shone pale
in the darkness the one great treasure of that unknown
mother, an almost life-size statue of the
Holy Virgin.</p>
<p>Of this beautiful thing Tharon had stood in
awe from babyhood.</p>
<p>A half fearful reverence bowed her before it
on those rare times when Anita, throwing back to
her Mexic ancestors, worshipped with vague rites
at its feet.</p>
<p>Always its waxen hands bore offerings, silent
tribute from the girl&#8217;s still nature. Sometimes
these were the prairie flowers, little wild things,
sweet and fragile. Sometimes they were sprays
of the water vines that grew by the wonderful
spring of the Holding.</p>
<p>Again they were strings of bright beads, looped
and falling in glistening cascades over the tarnished
gilt robes of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Under the deep window there was a wide couch,
piled high with a narrow mattress of wild goose
feathers and covered with a crimson blanket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Here the girl sat with her arms on the sill and
looked out into the darkness that covered the
Valley. She thought of the thirty men who had
signed her paper, riding far and by in the sounding
basin, returning to their uncertain homes. She
thought of her father asleep under his peaceful
cross, of young Harkness beside him.</p>
<p>She thought of Courtrey and Service and
Wylackie Bob, of Black Bart and the stranger
from Arizona. They were a hard bunch to
tackle.</p>
<p>They had the Valley under their thumbs to do
with as they pleased, like the veriest Roman potentate
of old. Her daddy had told her once, when
she was small and lonely of winter nights, strange
old tales of rulers and their helpless subjects. Jim
Last could talk when he needed, though he was
a man of conserved speech.</p>
<p>Yes, Courtrey was like a king in Lost Valley,
absolute. She thought of the many crimes done
and laid to his door since she could remember, of
countless cattle run off, of horses stolen and shamelessly
ridden in grinning defiance of any who
might dare to identify them, of Cap Hart killed
on the Stronghold&#8217;s range and left to rot under the
open skies, a warning like those birds of prey that
are shot and hung to scare their kind. Her soft
lips drew themselves into a hard line, very like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Jim Last&#8217;s, and the heart in her ratified its treaty
with the thirty men.</p>
<p>She had none to mourn her, she thought a trifle
sadly&ndash;&ndash;well Anita and Paula, of course, and there
were her riders. Billy would grieve&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;d kill
some one if she were killed&ndash;&ndash;and Conford and
Jack.</p>
<p>A warm glow pervaded her being. Yes, she had
folks, even if she was the last of her blood.</p>
<p>But she didn&#8217;t intend to be killed. She was
right, and she had listened enough to Anita to
believe with a superstitious certainty, that right
was invulnerable. For instance, if she and Courtrey
should draw at the same second, she believed
absolutely, that because she was in the right, her
bullet would travel a bit the swifter, her aim be
truer. She felt in her heart with a profound conviction
that some day she would kill Courtrey.
She thought of his wife, Ellen, a pale flower of a
woman, white as milk, with hair the colour of
unripe maize, and wondered if she loved the man
who made her life hell, so the Valley whispered.
Tharon wondered how it would seem to love a
man, as women who were wives must love their
men&ndash;&ndash;if the agony of loss to Ellen could be as
acute and terrifying as hers had been ever since
that soft night in spring when her best friend, Jim
Last, had come home on El Rey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>She thought of the grey look on his face, of
the pinched line at his nostrils&#8217; base, and the tears
came miserably under her lids, she laid her head on
the cloth mat that covered the wide window ledge
and wept like any child for a time. Then she
wiped her face with her hands, sighed, and fell
again to thinking.</p>
<p>An hour later as she rose to make ready for
bed, she thought she caught a faint sound out
where the little rock-bordered paths ran in what
she was pleased to call her garden, since a few
hardy flowers grew by the spring&#8217;s trickle, and
she held her breath to listen. It was nothing,
however, she thought, and turned into the deep
room.</p>
<p>Only the tree-toads, long since silent, knew that
a cigarette, carefully shielded in a palm, glowed
in the darkness.</p>
<p>Two days after this a visitor came to Last&#8217;s.
From far down they saw him coming, in the mid-morning
while the work of the house went forward.
Paula, bringing a pan of milk from the
springhouse spied him first and stopped to satisfy
her young eyes with the unwonted appearance of
him. She looked long, and hurried in to tell her
mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; she said excitedly, &#8220;see who comes!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
A stranger who has different clothes from
any other. He rides not like Lost Valley men,
either, being too stiff and straight. Come, see.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Tharon, busy about the kitchen in her
starched print dress, dropped everything at once
to run with Paula to the western door of the living
room that they might look south.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Muchachas</i> both,&#8221; complained old Anita,
&#8220;the milk is spilled and the <i>pan dulce</i> burns in the
oven! Tch, tch!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the young creatures in the west door cared
naught for her grumbling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can it be, to come so, Se&ntilde;orita?&#8221; wondered
Paula, her brown cheek beside her mistress,
&#8220;is he not handsome!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy sake, Paula,&#8221; chided Tharon
laughing, &#8220;I believe you&#8217;d look for beauty in th&#8217;
ol&#8217; Nick himself if he rode up. But I&#8217;ve seen
this man before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In town that day I met Courtrey an&#8217; Service.
I remember seen&#8217; him come into line as I backed
out&ndash;&ndash;he was standin&#8217; between th&#8217; racks an&#8217; th&#8217;
porch, somewhere.&#8221; And she narrowed her eyes
and studied the rider as he came jogging up across
the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; she said presently, &#8220;he does ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
funny. I bet he ain&#8217;t rode range much in <i>his</i> life.
Stiff as a ramrod, an&#8217; no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then with an unconscious grace and poise that
set well upon her as the mistress of Last&#8217;s, Tharon
moved into the open door and waited.</p>
<p>As the stranger came closer both girls subjected
him to a frank and careful scrutiny that in any
other place than Lost Valley would have been
rudeness itself.</p>
<p>Here it catalogued the stranger, set the style
of his welcome.</p>
<p>It left him stripped of surprise, outwardly,
before he was within speaking distance.</p>
<p>It told the observers that he was young, of some
twenty-six or seven, that his face, the first point
taken in with lightning swiftness&ndash;&ndash;was different
from most faces they had ever seen, that it was
open, smiling, easy, that he was straight as a
ramrod, indeed, that he rode as if he feared
nothing in the earth or the heavens, that he carried
no gun, that he wore the peculiar uniform that
Tharon had noticed before, and that there was
something on his breast, a dark shield of some
sort which made them think of Steptoe Service and
his disgraced sheriff&#8217;s star. This thought brought
a frown to Tharon&#8217;s brows, and it was there to
greet the stranger when he rode up to the step and
halted, his smart tan hat in his hand. The morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
sun burned warmly down on his dark hair,
which was brushed straight back from his forehead
in a way unknown in those parts. His dark
eyes, slow and deep but somehow merry, took in
the pretty picture in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Last?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tharon promptly and waited.</p>
<p>Every one waited in Lost Valley for a stranger
to make known his business. Paula drew back
behind her mistress.</p>
<p>The man sat still on his horse and waited, too.
The silence became profound. The hens cackling
about the barns intruded sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I am a stranger,
and I came to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl in the doorway felt a hot surge of
discomfort flare over her for the first time in her
life for such a reason.</p>
<p>There was something in the low voice that implied
a lack, accused her of something. She
resented it instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is so,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;light.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed delightedly, and swung
quickly down, dropping his rein. Tharon noticed
that. That much was natural. He held his hat
against his breast with one hand and came forward
with the same quickness, holding out the
other. Tharon was not used to shaking hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
with strange men. She gave her hand diffidently,
because he so evidently expected it, and took it
away swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is Kenset&ndash;&ndash;David
Kenset, and I am from Washington, D. C.&#8221;</p>
<p>He might as well have said Timbuctoo. Tharon
Last knew little outside her own environment.
Words and names that had to do with unknown
places were vague things to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she answered politely, &#8220;I make no
doubt you&#8217;ve come far. Come in. Dinner&#8217;ll soon
be ready,&#8221; and she moved back from the door
with a smile that covered her pitiful ignorance as
with a garment of gold. When Tharon smiled
like that she was wholly adorable, and the man
knew it at once.</p>
<p>Why she had so quickly invited him in before
he had fully declared himself, she did not know,
unless it was because of that lack in her which his
first words had implied.</p>
<p>Old Anita, whose manners were the simple and
perfect ones of the Mexican coupled to a kindly
heart, had taught her how to comport.</p>
<p>Her easy and constant association with the
riders and <i>vaqueros</i> had dulled her somewhat, but
she could be royal on occasion.</p>
<p>Now she simply stepped back in the deep cool
room where the <i>ollas</i> swung in the windows, smiled&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
she was changed entirely from the girl of a
few moments before.</p>
<p>The man came in, laid his hat on the flat top
of the melodeon, walked over to a chair and sat
down. There was an ease about him, a taking-for-granted,
that amazed Tharon beyond words.</p>
<p>Then he looked frankly at her and began to
talk as if he had known her always.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to live in Lost Valley, Miss Last,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;for a long while, I think. Wish me
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here to live?&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;a settler?
Goin&#8217; to homestead?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick suspicion seized her. Perhaps Washington
was like Arizona, a place from which they
imported gun men. Only this man wore no gun,
and he had not a look of prowess. No. This
man was different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; she asked as
frankly as a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going up where the pines
grow yonder and build myself a house,&#8221; and he
waved a hand toward the east where the ranges
rolled up to the thickening fringes of the forest
that marched back into the ramparts of the trail-less
hills.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to find an ideal spot, a glade where
the pines stand round the edges, with a spring of
living water running down, and where I can look
down and over the magnificent reaches of Lost
Valley. I shall make me a home, and then I shall
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride?&#8221; asked the girl succinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride? Of course, that will be a great part of
that work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who for?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hard quality in her voice. If he
had come in to ride for Courtrey, why he must
know at once that Last&#8217;s was no friend of his,
now or ever.</p>
<p>He caught the drift of her thought in part.</p>
<p>&#8220;For no outfit, Miss Last,&#8221; he said with a
gentle dignity. &#8220;I am in the employ of the
United States Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>A swift change came over Tharon&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Government!</p>
<p>That was no word to conjure by in Lost Valley.
Steptoe Service prated of Gov&#8217;ment. It was a
farce, a synonym for juggled duty, a word to suggest
the one-man law of the place, for even Courtrey,
who made the sheriffs&ndash;&ndash;and unmade them&ndash;&ndash;did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
it under the grandiloquent name of Government.
She looked at him keenly, and there was a
sudden hardening in her young eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I reckon, Mister,&#8221; she said coolly,
&#8220;that you an&#8217; me can&#8217;t be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly am,&#8221; said Tharon. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t on
good terms at present with anything that has t&#8217; do
with law.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Kenset leaned forward and looked into
her face with his deep, compelling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed as much from my first knowledge
of you the other day,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but we are
on unfamiliar ground. You have a wrong conception
of Government, a perverted idea of law
and what it stands for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mister,&#8221; said the girl rising. &#8220;We
won&#8217;t argy. I asked you t&#8217; dinner, but I take it
back. I ask ye t&#8217; forgive me my manners, but th&#8217;
sooner we part th&#8217; better. Then we won&#8217;t be a-hurtin&#8217;
each other&#8217;s feelin&#8217;s. I&#8217;m fer law, too,
but it ain&#8217;t your kind, an&#8217; we ain&#8217;t likely to agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>She picked up his hat from where it lay on the
melodeon and fingered it a bit, smiling at him in
the ingenuous manner that was utterly disarming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>A slow dark flush spread over the man&#8217;s face.
He laughed, however, and in reaching for the hat,
caught two of her fingers, whether purposely or
not, Tharon could not tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable hospitality in the last frontier,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But perhaps I should not have expected
anything different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me ashamed,&#8221; said Tharon
straightly, &#8220;but Last&#8217;s ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; chances these
days. You may belong to Government, an&#8217; you
may belong to Courtrey, an&#8217; I&#8217;m against &#8217;em
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked with him to the door, stepped out,
as if with some thought to soften her unprecedented
treatment of the stranger under her roof.
She noted the trim figure of him in its peculiar
garb, the proud carriage, the even and easy comportment
under insult.</p>
<p>From his saddle he untied a package wrapped
in paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please take this?&#8221; he asked lightly,
holding it out. &#8220;Just on general principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take no favours from you when I&#8217;ve
just took stand against you, can I?&#8221; she asked
in turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all the ridiculous&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed again shortly, tossed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
package on the step, mounted, whirled and rode
away without a backward glance.</p>
<p>Tharon stood frowning where he left her until
the brown horse and its rider were well down
along the levels toward Black Coulee.</p>
<p>Then a sigh at her shoulder recalled her and
she turned to see the wistful dark face of Paula
gazing raptly in the same direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was so handsome, Se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; said the
girl, &#8220;to be so hardly dealt with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paula,&#8221; said the mistress bitingly, &#8220;will you
remember who you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; to? Do you want
to go back to th&#8217; Pomos under th&#8217; Rockface?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saints forbid!&#8221; cried Paula instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then keep your sighs for Jos&eacute; an&#8217; mind your
manners. Pick up that bundle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly and obediently the girl did as she was
told, unrolling the wrapper from the package.</p>
<p>She brought to light the meal-sack which
Tharon had dropped that day on Baston&#8217;s porch.</p>
<p>A slow flush stained Tharon&#8217;s cheeks at the
sight, and she went abruptly into the house.</p>
<p>When the riders came in at night she told them
in detail about the whole affair, for Last&#8217;s and its
men were one, their interests the same.</p>
<p>They held counsel around the long table in the
dining room under the hanging lamp, and Conford
at her right was spokesman for the rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s somethin&#8217; official, all right, I make no
doubt, Tharon,&#8221; he said when he had listened
attentively, &#8220;but what or who I don&#8217;t know. I
heard from Dixon about him comin&#8217; into Corvan
that day, an&#8217; that he had rode far. No one knows
his business, or what he&#8217;s in Lost Valley for. He&#8217;s
some mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to stay, so he told me,&#8221; went on
the girl, &#8220;goin&#8217; to build a house up where the
pines begin an&#8217; means to ride. But how&#8217;ll he live?
What an&#8217; who will he ride for? He said for
Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there nothin&#8217; about him different?
Nothin&#8217; you could judge him by?&#8221; asked
Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there was. He wore somethin&#8217; on his
breast, a sign, a dull-like thing with words an&#8217;
letters on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; said Conford quickly, &#8220;what was it
like, Tharon? Can&#8217;t you describe it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can with a pencil,&#8221; said Tharon, rising.
&#8220;Come on in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went swiftly to the big desk in the other
room and rummaged among its drawers for paper
and pencil. These things were precious in Lost
Valley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Jim Last had had great stacks of paper, neat,
glazed sheets with faint lines upon them, made
somewhere in that mysterious &#8220;below&#8221; and
brought in by pack train. It was on one of these,
with the distinctive words &#8220;Last&#8217;s Holding&#8221;
printed at the top, that the thirty men had signed
themselves into the new law of the Valley.</p>
<p>To Tharon these sheets had always been magic,
invested with grave dignity.</p>
<p>Anything done upon them was of import,
irrevocable.</p>
<p>Thus had Jim Last inscribed the semi-yearly
letters that went down the Wall with the cattle,
or for supplies.</p>
<p>Now she spread a shining pad under the light,
sat down in her father&#8217;s chair and began, carefully
and minutely to reproduce the badge that
meant authority of a sort, yet was not a sheriff&#8217;s
star.</p>
<p>The riders, clustered at her shoulder, watched
the thing take shape and form. At the end of
twenty painstaking minutes Tharon straightened
and looked up in the interested faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; its dull copper
colour!&#8221;</p>
<p>And this was the shield with its unknown
heraldry which Conford took up and studied carefully
for a long time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Forest Service,&#8217;&#8221; he read aloud, &#8220;&#8216;Department
of Agriculture.&#8217; Well, so far as I can see,
it ain&#8217;t so terrifyin&#8217;. That last means raisin&#8217;
things, like beets an&#8217; turnips an&#8217; so on, an&#8217; as for
th&#8217; forest part, why, if he stays up in his &#8216;fringe o&#8217;
pines&#8217; I guess we ain&#8217;t got no call to kick. Don&#8217;t
you worry, Tharon, about this new bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a darned sight more worried about that
other one, th&#8217; Arizona beauty which Courtrey&#8217;s
got in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget th&#8217; gun man, Burt,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;this
feller&#8217;s a heap more interestin&#8217; to me, for I&#8217;ve got
a hunch he&#8217;s a poet. Now who on this footstool
but a poet would come ridin&#8217; into Lost Valley with
his badge o&#8217; beets an&#8217; his line o&#8217; talk about &#8216;fringes
o&#8217; pines&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;runnin&#8217; streams,&#8217; to quote Tharon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even poets are human, you young limb,&#8221;
drawled Curly in his soft voice, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m sorry
for him if he starts your &#8216;interest,&#8217; so to speak.
He&#8217;ll need all his poetic vision t&#8217; survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Billy,&#8221; said Tharon severely, and with
lofty inconsistency, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll remember your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
manners an&#8217; not start anything. Last&#8217;s is in for
trouble enough without any side issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the boy instantly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll promise
to leave th&#8217; poet alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the talk fell about the new well that had
taken the place of the old Crystal and which was
proving a huge success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t draw her dry,&#8221; said Bent Smith, &#8220;pulled
all of three hours with Nick Bob an&#8217; Blue Pine
yesterday an&#8217; never even riled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s good as th&#8217; Gold Pool or th&#8217; Silver
Hollow now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some range man t&#8217; make any such a
comparison,&#8221; said Curly with conviction, &#8220;there
ain&#8217;t no artificial water-well extent that can hold a
candle t&#8217; th&#8217; real livin&#8217; springs of a cattle country,
when they&#8217;re such bubblin&#8217;, shinin&#8217; beauties as th&#8217;
Springs of Last&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Curly,&#8221; said Tharon quietly
from under the light, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; like them.
They must be th&#8217; blessin&#8217;s of God, an&#8217; no mistake.
They&#8217;re th&#8217; stars at night, an&#8217; th&#8217; winds an&#8217; th&#8217;
sunshine. They&#8217;re th&#8217; lovers of th&#8217; horses, th&#8217;
treasure of th&#8217; masters. I love my springs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do th&#8217; herds,&#8221; put in Jack Masters.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll come fast at night now because they can
smell th&#8217; water far off, an&#8217; it&#8217;s gettin&#8217; pretty dry
on th&#8217; range.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Tharon, &#8220;it&#8217;s summer now, an&#8217;
Jim Last died in spring. A whole season
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>A whole season had gone, indeed, since that
tragic night.</p>
<p>Last&#8217;s Holding had missed its master at each
turn and point. A thousand times did Conford,
the foreman, catch himself in the act of going
to the big room to find him at his desk, a big, vital
force, intent on the accounts of the ranch, a thousand
times did he long for his keen insight. The
<i>vaqueros</i> missed him and his open hand.</p>
<p>The very dogs at the steps missed him, and so
did El Rey, waiting in his corral for the step that
did not come, the strong hand on his bit.</p>
<p>And how much his daughter missed him only
the stars and the pale Virgin knew.</p>
<p>For the next few days following the short,
awkward visit of the stranger Tharon felt a
prickle of uneasiness under her skin at every
thought of it. There was something in the memory
that confused and distressed her, a feeling of
failure, of a lack in her that put her in a bad light
to herself.</p>
<p>She knew that, instinctively, she had been protecting
her own, that since Last&#8217;s had stepped out
in the light against Courtrey she must take no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
chance. But should she have taken back the common
courtesy of the offered meal? Would it not
have been better to let him stay and meet Conford
who would have been in at noon?</p>
<p>She vexed herself a while with these questions,
and then dismissed them with her cool good
sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done,&#8221; she told herself, &#8220;an&#8217; can&#8217;t be
helped. An&#8217; yet, there was somethin&#8217; about him,
somethin&#8217; that made me think of Jim Last himself&ndash;&ndash;somethin&#8217;
in his quiet eyes&ndash;&ndash;as if they had
both come from somewhere outside Lost Valley
where they grow different men. It was a&ndash;&ndash;bigness,
a softness. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that last wistful thought she forgot
all about the incident and the man, for the prediction
of Jameson that dusk at the head of Rolling
Cove became reality.</p>
<p>Dixon, who lived north along the Wall near
the Pomo settlement, lost ten head of steers, all
white and deeply earmarked, unmistakable cattle
that could not be disguised.</p>
<p>Courtrey was resenting the vague something
in the air that was crystallizing into resistance
about him.</p>
<p>Word of the stealing ran about the Valley
like a grass fire, more boldly than usual.</p>
<p>It came to Last&#8217;s in eighteen hours, brought by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
a horseman who had carried it to many a lonely
homestead.</p>
<p>Tharon received it with a thrill of joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; she said, &#8220;no use wasting
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she sent out a call for the thirty men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE WORKING OF THE LAW</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a clear, bright morning in early summer.
All up and down Lost Valley the little
winds wimpled the grass where the cattle
grazed, and brought the scent of flowers. In the
thin, clear atmosphere points and landmarks stood
out with wonderful boldness.</p>
<p>The homesteads set in the endless green like
tiny gems, the stupendous face of the Wall,
stretching from north to south and sheer as a
plumb line for a thousand feet, was fretted with
a myriad of tiny seams and crevasses not ordinarily
visible.</p>
<p>Far up at the Valley&#8217;s head against the huge
uplift of the jumbled and barren rocklands the
scattered squat buildings of the Stronghold
brooded like a monster.</p>
<p>Spread out on the velvet slopes below lay the
herds that belonged to it, sleek fat cattle, guarded
carelessly by a few lazy and desultory riders.
Courtrey was too secure in his insolent might to
take those rigid and untiring precautions which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
were the only price of safety to the lesser men of
the community. Toward the south where the Valley
narrowed to the Bottle Neck and the Broken
Bend went out, there shimmered and shone like
a silver ribbon hung down the cliff the thin, long
shower of Vestal&#8217;s Veil fall.</p>
<p>The roar of it could be heard for miles like the
constant and incessant wail of winds in time-worn
ca&ntilde;ons.</p>
<p>Along the floor of the Cup Rim range, sunken
and hidden from the upper levels, there rode a
compact group of horsemen. They went abreast,
in column of fours, and they were armed to the
teeth, a bristling presentation. All in all there
were forty-two of them and at their head rode
Tharon on El Rey, a slim and gallant young
figure.</p>
<p>Her bright hair, tied with a scarlet ribbon,
shone under her wide hat like an aureole. She
talked with Conford who rode beside her, and now
and then she smiled, for all the world as if she
went to some young folks&#8217; gathering, instead of to
the first uncertain issue of blind mob law against
outlaws.</p>
<p>But if she felt a lightness of excitement in her
heart it was more than actuated by the grim and
quiet band that followed.</p>
<p>They knew&ndash;&ndash;and she knew, also&ndash;&ndash;that what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
they did this day, in the open sunlight, meant
savage strife and bloodshed for some as sure as
death.</p>
<p>For two hours they rode across the sunken
range where the cottonwoods and aspens made a
lovely and mottled shade, to reach at last the
sharp ascent to the uplands above. When they
topped the rim and started forward, the huge
herds of Courtrey lay spread before them, bright
as paint on the living green. Two thousand cattle
grazed there in peace and plenty. Here and
there a rider sat his horse in idleness. At the
first sight of the solidly formed mass coming out
of the Cup Rim on to the levels, these riders
straightened in their saddles and rode in closer
to their charges.</p>
<p>The eyes of the newcomers went over the bright
pattern of the grazing cattle. A motley bunch
they were, red, black and white, with here and
there descendants of the yellows which none but
John Dement had ever owned in Lost Valley.
Dement, riding near the head of the line saw this
and muttered in his beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s some o&#8217; mine,&#8221; he said pointing, &#8220;th&#8217;
very ones that was stampeded. I&#8217;d know &#8217;em in
hell.&#8221;</p>

SHE TALKED WITH CONFORD WHO RODE BESIDE HER AND NOW AND THEN SHE SMILED<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>With the nearing of the line of horsemen a
rider detached himself from the right of the herd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
and went sailing away across the levels toward the
distant Stronghold.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash Tharon Last lifted the rifle that
lay ready on her pommel and sent a shot whining
toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to show we mean business,&#8221; she muttered
to herself.</p>
<p>The cowboy caught the warning and drew his
running horse up to slide ten feet on its haunches.</p>
<p>He had meant to warn his boss, but a chance
was one thing, certainty another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dixon&ndash;&ndash;Dement,&#8221; called Tharon rising in her
stirrups, &#8220;when we get to work you pick out as
near as you can, cattle that look like yours, an&#8217; th&#8217;
same amount&ndash;&ndash;not a head more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they swung forward at a run and swept
down along the left flank of the herd. Here a
rider raised his arm and fired point blank at the
leaders. One-two-three his six-gun counted. He
was a lean youngster, scarce more than a boy, a
wild admirer of Courtrey, and he stood his defence
with a sturdy gallantry that was worthy of
a better cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; he yelled, standing in his stirrups,
&#8220;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Law!&#8221; pealed the high voice of Tharon as
El Rey thundered down toward him. Then
Buford, riding midway of the sweeping line, fired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
and the boy dropped his gun, swayed and clung
to his saddle horn as his horse bolted and tore off
at a tangent to the right, away from the herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; cried the girl hoarsely, &#8220;I wish we
didn&#8217;t have to! Did you kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; called Buford sharply, &#8220;broke his arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon, to whom the high blue vault had
seemed suddenly to swing in strange circles, shut
her teeth with a click.</p>
<p>Abreast of the cattle she swerved El Rey aside,
drew her guns and waited.</p>
<p>In among the grazing cattle, many of which
had raised startled heads to eye the intruders,
went the men. They worked swiftly and deftly.
They knew that they were in plain sight of the
Stronghold and expected every moment to see
Courtrey and a dozen riders come boiling out.
Those cowboys who had been in charge of the
herd, sat where they were, without a move. Out
of the bright mass the settlers cut first the ten
head of steers, as nearly as possible all white, to
take the place of Dixon&#8217;s band. Thomas and
Black stood guard over them. Then they went
back and took out yellows and yellow-spotted to
the number of one hundred. It was fast work,
the fastest ever done on the Lost Valley ranges,
and every nerve was strained like a singing wire.</p>
<p>Under the dust cloud raised by the plunging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
hoofs, the whirling horses, the workers kept as
close together as possible.</p>
<p>They rounded up the cut-outs, bunched them
together compactly and swinging into a half circle,
drove them rapidly back toward the oak-fringed
edge of the Cup Rim. They passed close to where
the slim boy stood by his horse, trying to wind
the big red kerchief from his neck about his right
arm from which the blood ran in a bright stream.
Tharon swung out of her course and shot toward
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she cried swiftly, &#8220;let me tie it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hell with you,&#8221; said the lad bitterly, raising
blazing eyes to her face. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made me
false t&#8217; Courtrey. I&#8217;d die first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die, then!&#8221; she flung back, &#8220;an&#8217; tell your
master that th&#8217; law is workin&#8217; in this Valley at
last!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the last rider of the cavalcade went down
over the slanting edge of the Cup Rim there came
the sound of quick shots snapping in the distance
and the belated sight of riders streaming down
from the Stronghold hurried the descent.</p>
<p>They had reached the level floor of the sunken
range and spread out upon it for better travelling
before Courtrey and his men, some ten or fifteen
riders, appeared on the upper crest.</p>
<p>The settlers stopped instantly at a call from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
Conford, drew together behind the cattle, turned
and faced them. They were too far away for
speech, out of rifle range, but the still, grim
defiance of that compact front halted the outlaw
cattle king and his followers.</p>
<p>For the first time in all his years of rising power
in Lost Valley Courtrey felt a challenge. For the
first time he knew that a tide was banking in full
force against him. A red rage flushed up under
his dark skin, and he raised a silent fist and shook
it at the blue heavens.</p>
<p>The grim watchers below knew that gesture,
significant, majestic, boded ill to them.</p>
<p>But Tharon Last, muttering to herself in the
hatred that possessed her of late at sight of
Courtrey, raised her own doubled fist and shook
it high toward him, an answer, an acceptance of
that challenge.</p>
<p>Then they calmly turned and drove the recovered
cattle down along the sloping levels at a
fast trot.</p>
<p>The die was struck. Lost Valley was no longer
a stamping-ground for wrong and oppression. It
had gone to war.</p>
<p>That night the white and yellow herd bedded
at the Holding, <i>vaqueros</i> rode about it all night
long, quietly, softly under the stars. The settlers
walked about, smoking, or sat silently in the darkened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
living room. At midnight Tharon and young
Paula made huge pots of coffee which they dispensed
along with crullers.</p>
<p>By dawn the cattle were well on their way,
still safeguarded by the band of men, down toward
the homesteads where they belonged.</p>
<p>During that night of unlighted silence plans had
been perfected in low voices, a name chosen for
the band itself. They would call themselves the
Vigilantes, as many another organization had
called itself in the desperate straits that made its
existence imperative.</p>
<p>By sundown the hundred head had been driven,
hot and tired, into John Dement&#8217;s corrals, the ten
white steers were bedded by Black&#8217;s Spring over
toward the Wall. They had farther to go and
would not reach Dixon&#8217;s until the morning.</p>
<p>And with each band there was a group of determined
men.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Word of this exploit ran all over the Valley in
a matter of hours. To each faction it had a deep
significance.</p>
<p>But speech concerning it was sparse as it had
ever been anent the doings of Courtrey. A man&#8217;s
tongue was a prisoner to his common sense those
days.</p>
<p>To Tharon Last, busy at her tasks about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Holding, it was a vital matter. She felt a strong
surge, an uplift within her. She had begun the
task she had set herself and solemn joy pervaded
her being.</p>
<p>But of all those whom it affected there was
none to whom it meant what it did to Courtrey
himself. In him it set loose something which
burned in him like a consuming fire. Where he
had thought of Tharon Last before with a certain
intent, now he thought of her in a sort of madness.
He was a king himself, in a manner, an eagle, a
prowler of great spaces, a rule-or-ruin force.
Down there on the sloping floor of the Cup Rim
had been a fit mate for him in the slim girl who
had shaken her fist back at him in strong defiance.</p>
<p>He felt his blood leap hot at the thought of her.
She was built of fighting stuff. No pale willy-nilly,
like some he knew who wept whole fountains
daily. No&ndash;&ndash;neither was she like Lola of the
Golden Cloud, past-master of men because she had
belonged to many.</p>
<p>Courtrey, who had run life&#8217;s gamut himself,
thought of Tharon Last&#8217;s straight young purity
with growing desire.</p>
<p>It began to obsess him with a mania. His
temper, bad at all times, became worse. Ellen,
the veriest slave through her devotion to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
found her life at the Stronghold almost unbearable.</p>
<p>She was a white woman, like a lily, with transparent
flesh where the blue veins showed. Her
pale blue eyes, like the painted eyes of a china
doll, were red with constant tears under their corn-silk
lashes. The pale gold hair on her temples
was often damp with the sweat that comes with
agony of soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;It jes&#8217; seems I can&#8217;t live another minute,
Cleve,&#8221; she would tell her brother who lived at
the Stronghold, &#8220;seems like I don&#8217;t want to. Th&#8217;
very sunlight looks sad t&#8217; me, an&#8217; I hate th&#8217; tree-toads
that are singin&#8217; eternal down in th&#8217; runnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>This brother, her only relative, would stir uneasily
at such times and the fire that shot from his
eyes, light, too, under the same corn-silk lashes,
was a rare thing. Nothing but this had ever set
it burning. He was a slight man, narrow-chested
and thin. They had been from run-down stock,
these two, a strain that seemed indigenous to the
Valley, without other memories. Their name was
Whitmore, and they had lived all their lives in a
poor cove up beyond the Valley&#8217;s head where the
barren rocklands came down out of the skies.
There had been, besides themselves, only the
father and mother, worn-out workers, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
died at last, leaving the brother and sister to live
as best they might in the solitudes.</p>
<p>Here Courtrey had found them, both in their
teens, and he had promptly taken them both along
with their scant affairs. It was about the only
thing to his credit that he had married Ellen, hard
and fast enough, with the offices of a bona fide
justice, a matter which he had regretted often
enough in the years that followed.</p>
<p>It was this knowledge which set the light burning
in Cleve&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>He knew how Ellen loved Courtrey.</p>
<p>He knew also that Lola of the Golden Cloud
had made the cattle king step lively for over a
year. He saw the daily growing impatience with
which Courtrey regarded his marriage.</p>
<p>He resented with every ounce of the repressed
spirit there was in him the girl&#8217;s poor standing
at the Stronghold.</p>
<p>Black Bart and Wylackie Bob treated her with
no more consideration than any of the Indian
serving women. They swore and drank before
her with an abandon that made the young man&#8217;s
nails cut deep in his palms at times, the blood
mount high in his white cheeks.</p>
<p>And Ellen drooped like a lily on a broken stem,
brooded over her husband&#8217;s absences, and hated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
the name of Lola, used openly to her as a cruel
joke.</p>
<p>The Stronghold was a huge place. The house
was like the majority of the habitations of the
region, built of adobe and able to stand siege
against a regiment. It was shaded by cottonwoods
and spruces, flanked by corrals and barns
and sheds until the place resembled a small town.</p>
<p>Cleve Whitmore rode for Courtrey but his
heart was not in Courtrey&#8217;s game. He was slim
and sullen, dissatisfied, slow of speech, repressed.</p>
<p>He worked early and late and thought a lot.</p>
<p>Courtrey, who kept close count of the favours
he did for others, considered Cleve deep in his debt
and paid him a niggardly wage. So it was, that
when the newly organized Vigilantes under
Tharon Last came out in broad day and took back
their own from Courtrey&#8217;s herds, there was one
at the Stronghold who laughed quietly to himself
in sympathy with the defy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; he told the wide sky and the
silence as he rode herd under the beetling rocklands,
&#8220;hope t&#8217; God some one gits him good an&#8217;
plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Courtrey was hard to get. His aides and
lieutenants were picked men. He was like a king
in his domain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>But if strife and ferment seethed under the
calm surface in Lost Valley, its surges died before
they reached the rolling slopes where the forests
came down to the eastern plains. Up among the
pines and oaks, the ridges and the age-worn,
tumbled rocks David Kenset had found his ideal
spot, his glade where the pines stood guard and a
talking stream ran down. High on the wooded
slopes he had set his mark, begun that home of
which he had told Tharon. From Corvan he
had hired three men, a teamster by the name of
Drake and his two sons, and together they had
felled and dressed trees enough for a cabin, laid
them up with clay brought five miles on mule-back,
roofed the structure with shakes made on the
spot with a froe, and the result was pleasing, indeed,
to this man straight from the far eastern
cities.</p>
<p>The cabin faced southwest, set at an angle to
command the circled glade, the dropping slopes,
the distant range lands, the wooded line of the
Broken Bend, and farther off the levels and slants
of the gently undulating Valley, with the mighty
Rockface of the Wall rising like a mystery beyond.
Kenset cut all trees at the west and south of the
glade, thus forming a splendid doorway into his
retreat, through which all this shone in, like
those wonderful etched landscapes one sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sees in tiny toys that fit the narrowed eye.</p>
<p>Before the cabin was finished, Starret, who ran
the regular pack-train, brought in a string of
trunks and boxes which caused much curious comment
in Corvan. These came up, after much
delay, to be dumped in the door yard of the house
in the glade, and Kenset felt as if the gateway to
the outside world might close and he care very
little.</p>
<p>Here was the wilderness, in all verity, here was
work, that greatest of boons, here were health and
plenty and the hazard of outlawry, that he was
beginning to dimly sense under the calmly flowing
currents of Lost Valley.</p>
<p>And here was Romance, as witness the slim girl
who had backed out from a group of men that
first day of his coming&ndash;&ndash;backed out with her guns
upon them, himself included, and mounted a silver
stallion, whose like he had not known existed. In
fact, Kenset had thought he knew horses, but he
stood in open-mouthed wonder before the horses
of Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;the magnificent Ironwood bays
of Courtrey&#8217;s, with their wonderful long manes
and tails that shone like a lady&#8217;s hair, the Finger
Marks which he had seen once or twice, and
marvelled at.</p>
<p>With the opening of the boxes the cabin in the
glade took on a look of home, of individuality. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
big dark rug, woven of strong cord in green and
brown, came out and went down on the rough
floor, leather runners were flung on the two tables,
a student lamp of nickel, a pair of old candlesticks
in hammered brass, added their touch of gleam
and shine to table and shelf-above-the-hearth, college
pennants, in all the colours of the rainbow,
were hung about the walls between four fine prints
in sepia, gay cushions, much the worse for wear,
landed in the handsome chairs, and lastly, but far
from being least, three long shelves beneath the
northern windows were filled to the last inch with
books.</p>
<p>When all these things had been put in place
Kenset stood back and surveyed the room with a
smile in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some spot,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;some spot!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the small table that was to do duty as a desk
in the corner between the southwest window and
the fireplace he stacked neatly a mass of literature,
all marked with the same peculiar shield of
the pine trees and the big U.&nbsp;S. that shone always
on his breast.</p>
<p>To the Drakes these things were of quick interest,
but they asked no questions.</p>
<p>When the last thing had been done to the cabin
they set to work and built a smaller cabin for the
good brown horse which Kenset had bought far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
down to the south and west in the Coast Country,
for Sam Drake told him that Lost Valley
locked its doors to all the world in winter. He
would house his only friend as he housed himself.</p>
<p>When the Drakes, father and sons, were gone
back down to Corvan for good, Kenset stretched
himself, physically and mentally, and began his
life in the last frontier.</p>
<p>He began to be out from dawn to dark riding
the ridges, exploring the wooded slopes, the
boldly upsweeping breasts of the nameless mountains,
making friends with the rugged land. It
was a beautiful country, hushed and silent, save for
the soft song of the pines, the laughter of streams
that ran to the Valley, cold as snow and clear as
wind. Strange flowers nodded on tall stems in
glade and opening, peeped from the flat earth by
stone and moss-bed. Few birds were here,
though squirrels were plentiful.</p>
<p>Sometimes he saw a horseman sitting on some
slant watching him intently. These invariably
rode rapidly away on being discovered, not troubling
to return his salute of a hand waved high
above him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny tribe,&#8221; he told himself, half puzzled,
half irritated, &#8220;their manners seem to be peculiarly
their own. As witness the offered meal so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
calmly &#8216;taken back&#8217; by the young highway-woman
of Last&#8217;s Holding.&#8221;</p>
<p>That had rankled. Sane as Kenset was, as cool
and self-contained, he could not repress a cold
prickle of resentment at that memory.</p>
<p>He had gone to the Holding in such good faith,
actuated by a lively desire to see Tharon again
after that one amazing meeting at Baston&#8217;s steps,
and he had been so readily received at first, so
coolly turned out at last. But he had not forgotten
the look in the girl&#8217;s blue eyes, nor the disarming
smile which had seemed to make it reasonable.</p>
<p>She merely did not hold with law, and wanted
him to have no false impressions. This incident
furnished him with more food for thought than
he was aware of in those first long days when he
rode the silent forest.</p>
<p>What was Tharon Last, anyway? What did
she mean by those words of hers about his law
and hers? That they were not the same sort of
law&ndash;&ndash;that he and she would not agree?</p>
<p>They could not be friends, she had said.</p>
<p>Well, Kenset was not so sure of that. There
was something about this girl of the guns that
sent a thrill tingling in his blood already, made
him recall each expression of her speaking face,
each line of her lean young figure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>He did not go near Last&#8217;s again, though his
business took him far and by in the Valley, for the
big maps, hung on a rack beyond his fireplace,
covered full half the ranges thereof and stretched
away into the mysterious and illimitable forests
that went up and away into the eastern mountains.</p>
<p>It was as if some fateful Power at Washington
had set down a careless finger on a map of the
U.\S.\A., and said to Kenset, &#8220;Here is your
country,&#8221; without knowledge or interest. Sometimes
he wondered if there was another forest
in the land as utterly lost as this, as little known.</p>
<p>But with this wonder came a thrill. He had read
romances of the great West in his youth and felt
a vague regret that he had not lived in the rollicking
days of &#8217;49. Now as he rode his new domain
he smiled to himself and thought that out of a
modern college he had been set back half a century.
Here was the rule of might, if he was not
mistaken. Here was romance in its most vital
and appealing form. Yes, he felt himself lucky.</p>
<p>So he took up his life and his duties with a vim.
He rode early and late, took notes and gathered
data for his first reports, and set up for himself
in Lost Valley a spreading antagonism.</p>
<p>If he rode herd on the range lands, the timber
sections, there were those who rode herd on him.
Not a movement of his that was not reported faithfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to Courtrey, not a coming or going that was
not watched from start to finish.</p>
<p>And the cattle king narrowed his eyes and listened
to his lieutenants with growing disapproval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Took up land, think?&#8221; he asked Wylackie
Bob. &#8220;Homesteadin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wylackie shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; accordin&#8217; to entry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no
more&#8217;n th&#8217; cabin. Don&#8217;t see no signs of tillin&#8217;.
He ain&#8217;t fencin&#8217;, nor goin&#8217; to fence, as near as I
can find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Nor horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hogs, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it! maybe it&#8217;s sheep!&#8221; and the red
flush rose in the bully&#8217;s dark cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think so. Seems like he&#8217;s after somethin&#8217;,
but what it is I can&#8217;t make out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was not long before the Stronghold
solved the mystery, for Kenset rode boldly in one
day and introduced himself.</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon, for the cabin in the glade
lay a long way from the Valley&#8217;s head, and the
whole big place lay silent as death in the summer
sun.</p>
<p>The Indian serving women were off in the
depths somewhere, the few <i>vaqueros</i> left at home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
were out about the spreading corrals, and all the
men that counted at the ranch had ridden into
Corvan early in the day.</p>
<p>Only Ellen, pale as a flower, her sweet mouth
drooping, sat listlessly on the hard beaten earth at
the eastern side of the squat house where the
spruce trees grew, her hands folded in her lap, a
sunbonnet covering the golden mass of her hair.</p>
<p>At the sound of his horse&#8217;s hoofs on the stone-flagged
yard Kenset saw her start, half rise, fling
a startled look at him and then sink back, as if even
the advent of a stranger was of slight import in
the heavy current of her dull life.</p>
<p>He came in close, drew up, and, with his hat
in his hand, sat smiling down at her. To Kenset
it was more natural to smile than not to.</p>
<p>The girl, for she was scarce more, looked up at
him and he saw at once, even under the disfiguring
headgear, that here was a breaking heart laid open
for all eyes. The very droop and tremble of the
lips were proof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Courtrey?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>
<p>At the words, the smile, the unusual courtesy of
the removed hat, Ellen rose from her chair, a tall,
slim wisp of a woman, whose blue-veined hands
were almost transparent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, and waited.</p>
<p>That little waiting, calm, unruffled, made him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
think sharply of Tharon Last who had waited
also for his accounting for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Kenset,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of over in the foothills.
Is your husband at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ellen, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone in t&#8217; Corvan.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a world of meaning in the inflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? Now that&#8217;s too bad. It&#8217;s taken me a
long time to come and I particularly wished to see
him. Do you mind if I wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Ellen a bit reluctantly, &#8220;no,
sir, I guess not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset swung off the brown horse and dropped
the rein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tired, Captain?&#8221; he asked whimsically, rubbing
the sweaty mane, while the animal drew a
long whistling breath and in turn rubbed the sticky
brow band on its forehead on Kenset&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like he&#8217;s thirsty,&#8221; said Ellen presently.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a trough round yonder at th&#8217; back,&#8221;
and she waved a long hand.</p>
<p>Kenset led Captain around back where a living
spring sang and gurgled into a section of tree,
deeply hollowed and covered with moss.</p>
<p>When he came back to the shade the woman
had brought from some near place a second chair,
and he dropped gratefully into it, weary from his
long ride.</p>
<p>He laid his hat on the earth beside him and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
smoothed the sleek, dark hair back from his
forehead.</p>
<p>Ellen sat still and watched him with a steady
gaze.</p>
<p>She was finding him strange. She looked at his
olive drab garments, at the trim leather leggings
that encased his lower limbs, at his smooth hands,
at his face, and lastly at the dark shield on his
breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law?&#8221; she asked succinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; smiled Kenset, &#8220;after a fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved uneasily in her chair, and the man
had a sudden feeling of pity for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as you mean, Mrs. Courtrey,&#8221; he hastened.
&#8220;I am in the United States Forest Service,
if you know what that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ellen, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is simply a service for the conservation
of the timber of this country,&#8221; he explained gently,
but he saw that he was not making it clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The saving of the trees,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;the
care of the forests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look after the ranges, protect the woods
from fire, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look after th&#8217; ranges? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulate grazing, grant permits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Permits?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; And seeing that at last he had caught
her interest, Kenset talked quietly for an hour
and told her more than he had vouchsafed any
other in Lost Valley about his work.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, he fell to talking to amuse
her, for he saw the emptiness behind the big blue
eyes, the aching void which there was nothing to
fill, neither love nor hope.</p>
<p>As the sun sank lower toward the west Ellen
took off the atrocity of calico and starch, and he
saw with wonder the amazing beauty of her ropes
of hair.</p>
<p>When he ceased talking the silence became profound,
for she had nothing to say and speech did
not come easy to her anyway. He did not know
that at the windows and behind the door-jambs of
the deep old house were clustered almost a
dozen dusky women and children, drawn from
all over the place and listening in utter
silence.</p>
<p>Unconsciously he had drifted back to his life in
the outside world, encouraged by the absorbing
interest of the pale eyes that never left his face.
He told Ellen of boat races on the Hudson, of
theatres on Broadway, of college pranks and frolics,
ranged over half the continent in little story
and snatch of description.</p>
<p>Neither one noticed how the shadows were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
lengthening, nor that the sun had dropped in
majesty behind the mighty Wall.</p>
<p>It took the sound of running horses, many of
them coming up along the slopes, to bring Kenset
back to the present with a snap, to make the
woman reach swiftly for the bonnet and clap it
on her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Courtrey,&#8221; said Kenset hurriedly, &#8220;this
has been the first real talk I have had with any
of my neighbours, and I want to thank you for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; quavered the woman, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
as I&#8217;d ought to a-let you stayed! Mebby I&#8217;d
oughtn&#8217;t. But&ndash;&ndash;but seems like you bein&#8217; so different,
an&#8217; I not seein&#8217; no one, come day in day out,
w&#8217;y I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he returned quickly, understanding.
&#8220;You did just right. I wanted to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he rose to his feet and there came the
thunder of the horses, the noise of men stopping
from a run, dismounting.</p>
<p>Ellen rose and he followed her around the
corner of the house to the door yard.</p>
<p>As they waited, Courtrey, clad in dark leather
chaps, his guns swinging, came toward them. At
sight of Kenset he stopped short and an oath rolled
from his lips. The kerchief at his neck was turned
knot-back and hung like a glob of crimson blood
upon his breast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Under his hat, set at an angle, his dark hair
fluffed strangely.</p>
<p>He was a splendid figure of a man, broad
shouldered, slim hipped.</p>
<p>Now he looked hard at the stranger and a slow
grin lifted his upper lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he said, and there was a light
suspicion of thickness in his voice, &#8220;my wife got
com-ny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset heard the woman catch her breath, and
the feeling of pity that had taken him at first for
her intensified.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Courtrey,&#8221; he said advancing, &#8220;but
you have,&#8221; and he held out his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Kenset, from the foothills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtrey, not four feet from him, did not look
at the hand. Instead the glittering eyes under the
hat-brim looked steadily into his with an expression
that only one man in a hundred could have interpreted.</p>
<p>That one man, however, stood by the watering
trough, his hand on the neck of a drinking horse&ndash;&ndash;Cleve
Whitmore who watched Courtrey without
blinking.</p>
<p>For a moment Kenset stood so, his hand extended,
waiting. Then the colour rose in his face
and he drew back the hand, raised it, scrutinized
it smilingly, and put it quietly on his hip.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>Still smiling he raised his eyes again to Courtrey&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtrey,&#8221; he said, this time without the Mr.,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to Lost Valley to <i>stay</i>. I had hoped
to be friends with all my neighbours. It would
have made my work easier. However, with or
without, I stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he picked up his hat, set it on his head,
walked over to the brown horse, flung up the
rein, mounted and rode out of the Stronghold in
utter silence.</p>
<p>His face was flaming, the blood of outraged
dignity and deep anger beat in his temples like a
drum. As he rode farther away he heard the
embarrassing silence broken by the hoarse shouts
of laughter of half drunken men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; he said aloud, clinching his fists on
his saddle horn, &#8220;this is part of my duty. The
Big Chief was right when he said, &#8216;If you help
the Service to tame Lost Valley you&#8217;ve got your
work cut out.&#8217; It&#8217;s a man-size job. I mustn&#8217;t
doubt my ability.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>EL REY AND BOLT</h3>
</div>
<p>Tharon Last and all her followers held
themselves in readiness for anything in the
days that followed the taking of the herds
from Courtrey&#8217;s range.</p>
<p>They locked their doors at night, stood double
guard at corral and stable. Mothers scattered
throughout Lost Valley gathered in their little
ones and watched the slopes and levels when their
men were out.</p>
<p>But a strange quietness seemed to settle down
upon them. That for which they waited did not
materialize. Courtrey and his gun men rode into
Corvan and up and down the Valley on mysterious
missions which were as unsettling as open depredations,
but nothing happened. In fact, Courtrey,
burning with the new desire that was beginning to
obsess him, was working out a new design.</p>
<p>He began to draw away from Lola. His triweekly
visits to the Golden Cloud dropped off a
bit. He took to drifting about from saloon to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
saloon, to being less pronounced in his frequenting
of one or two places.</p>
<p>His cold eyes, however, set in their narrow slits
beneath the heavy brows, picked out every settler
that he met and promised vague things for the
future. He knew to a man who had ridden up
from Last&#8217;s that day, and he meant that not one
should escape full payment&ndash;&ndash;some time. Now
he thought of the girl who had defied him and
he waited with leaping pulse. The memory of
that kiss, taken by violence at her western door,
was with him night and day. She stood for right
and the dignity of order. He meant, for a time,
to play her hand.</p>
<p>Therefore the settlers waited, and held their
breath while they did so.</p>
<p>And Courtrey took to riding much more alone,
to watching the slopes and stretches with a hand
at his hat-brim, shading his keen eyes. He looked
far and wide in the golden summer land for the
sight of a silver horse cutting down the wind
with a slim girl in saddle.</p>
<p>But Tharon was busy at the Holding and El
Rey stamped and whistled in his paddock. The
mistress knew that she had set stern tides flowing
in the Valley, that sooner or later they were due
to sweep away the peace and quiet that pervaded
the cottonwoods and the singing springs. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
knew that Courtrey waited, but she made the
most of that waiting.</p>
<p>Conford and Billy and the rest of the riders
made strong bolts for all the doors of the house,
reinforced the fences that held the herds at night,
put trick locks on all the gates.</p>
<p>But the time came when the close retreat became
irksome to the girl, and she went from room to
room in an uneasiness that was foreign to her
calm and happy nature. She read over and over
the two or three old books that had been at the
Holding since she could remember, made new
covers for the tables in the living room, kept the
hands of the Virgin full of fresh offerings. But
these things staled.</p>
<p>She began to long for the distances, the open
spaces, the feel of the swooping stallion under
her sailing down the wind. Courtrey or no Courtrey,
she could not fight it down. So, on a golden
day when all the boys were out with the herds and
only the Indian <i>vaqueros</i> left in charge by Conford
were at the stables, she flung the big saddle
with its silver studs and its sombre stain on El
Rey, mounted and went out and away like the
wind itself. Not since the day of the raid on
Courtrey&#8217;s stolen herds had she been on El Rey&#8217;s
back and the first long leap and drop of the great
horse beneath her set the lights to sparkling in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
her eyes, the blood to burning in her golden
cheeks. She lay low on his neck and let him run,
and her heart leaped up with lightness as it ever
did when she rode in these thundering bursts.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center; width: 378px;'>
IN FACT COURTREY, BURNING WITH THE NEW DESIRE THAT WAS BEGINNING TO OBSESS HIM, WAS WORKING OUT A NEW DESIGN<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>There was no other horse in Lost Valley like
the great king! Neither Redbuck nor Golden nor
Drumfire! Neither Sweetheart nor Westwind!
No, nor any Ironwood Bay that came down from
Courtrey&#8217;s Stronghold, Bolt and Arrow not
excepted.</p>
<p>Tharon laughed and stroked the king&#8217;s neck,
thewed like steel beneath her hands. She had no
fear of Courtrey and his hired killers. Sooner or
later the issue would come, of course. Then she
would kill the man as she had promised Jim Last,
without a thought.</p>
<p>Nay, she thought of Ellen, fragile white flower,
of whom she had heard.</p>
<p>A softening came about her young mouth at
thought of her, a shadow flickered in her blue
eyes for a moment. Then it was gone and she
laughed, a whooping gale of joy, there alone in
the green stretches between the earth and sky,
with the note of El Rey&#8217;s speed steadily rising in
her ears.</p>
<p>It beat in her very heart, that singing note. She
loved the king as she loved nothing else on earth,
save only the memory of her father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>She went south toward the Black Coulee and
she thanked her stars that her riders were grazing
the herds north toward the Cup Rim. Here there
was none to say her nay, to urge her with loving
solicitude to go back.</p>
<p>The miles sped backward and she scarce noted
their travel. She drew the king down a bit, slowed
him from the swooping run, set him into the wonderful
rock-and-away of the singlefoot and retied
the ribbon on her hair. She wore no hat this day
and the tawny cloud of her hair fluffed back from
her forehead, straining at its bands, its loose ends
standing up like fairy stuff all over her head. So,
with her two arms held high above her and the
reins in her teeth, she rode down by the mouth of
Black Coulee&ndash;&ndash;and up from the depths of the
rugged wash that split the plain for seven miles
there came across her path a man on a great bay
horse.</p>
<p>Courtrey on Bolt! She knew the beautiful animal
even so far away. It did not need the challenging
toss of El Rey&#8217;s head, the piercing scream
that rang from his open mouth across the silence,
nor the sudden lunge and strain against the bit.</p>
<p>That was Bolt, the mighty, and no mistake.
None but Arrow carried his splendid head so
regally, <i>none</i> other bore so huge a cloud of mane
on his arching neck, so long a tail that spread like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
a fan between his knees and almost swept the
ground.</p>
<p>So, Courtrey came out of the Coulee to meet
her! He would, maybe, force the issue. But
Tharon was not ready for that. What was plain
killing? No, she wanted more than that.
She wanted to see him scourged and beaten,
humiliated and robbed as he had robbed Lost
Valley.</p>
<p>So she turned El Rey, though it took the whole
strength of her young arms, and headed him
back the way they had come. With the first turn
and straightening leap her heart thumped hard
against her ribs.</p>
<p>There, between her and the Holding, far distant,
there were two riders&ndash;&ndash;and they rode bay
horses, both!</p>
<p>She made no doubt that they were Wylackie
Bob and Black Bart, on Arrow and Slingshot.</p>
<p>A sudden mist of fear came across her eyes. A
tightening caught her throat. She looked around
the illimitable spaces that stretched away on all
sides. There was nothing in all the spreading
plains but the three riders, sprung from nowhere,
it seemed, and herself.</p>
<p>Courtrey came rapidly up toward her, swinging
a bit to the west. The others, set somewhat apart
to right and left, bore down upon her. It looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
very much as if they meant to ride her down to the
Black Coulee.</p>
<p>Once in its sheltering deep wash she would be
helpless, cut off from escape. The Black Coulee
went back into the eastern hills, lost itself up in
the rugged and torturous clefts and chasms that
cut the unknown ramparts, dark with forest and
mysterious.</p>
<p>No! Not the Black Coulee and Courtrey to take
her prisoner!</p>
<p>She looked this way and that. Then she saw
that toward her right she had some margin. There
was space there to swing away from the man in
front who came like the wind itself toward her.
She caught the seeming of great speed and her
heart leaped again.</p>
<p>She recalled the day she had asked Jack Masters
if Bolt could run like El Rey.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; he had answered. &#8220;I
know it was speed, an&#8217; that is all.&#8221; True enough.
It was Bolt, coming like his namesake, down along
the sloping stretches.</p>
<p>But a great wave of exultation swept over her.
She rose in her stirrups, shook an insulting hand
above her, dropped on El Rey&#8217;s neck, swerved
him east and swept away toward the lifting skirts
of the wooded hills. She heard a yell behind her,
glanced back and saw that the three Ironwoods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
were sweeping behind her, closing in together. It
was to be a race at last!</p>
<p>At last the whispered comparisons that had
stirred under the speech of the Valley concerning
the Ironwoods and the Finger Marks was to have
justification. For the first and only time, in her
knowledge, they were to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; cried Tharon aloud. &#8220;Come
on, you bastards! It&#8217;s the king you come against
an&#8217; Jim Last&#8217;s blood! You&#8217;ll never put a hand
on either.&#8221;</p>
<p>She struck her heels into El Rey&#8217;s flanks, leaned
over her pommel, wished she was on the king&#8217;s
bare back, reached her hands far out along the
reins and began to call in his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeeoo! Yeeoo! Yeeoo!&#8221; she cried, a high,
exciting note that keened in the singing wind. And
El Rey, ever keen to run for no reason, finding
himself called upon, stretched out his great body,
dropped low to earth and began to run. The wind
cut by Tharon&#8217;s face like a knife in the first few
leaps.</p>
<p>It shut her eyes in a dozen. She rode and
laughed with a half sob in her throat. The
thunder of the king&#8217;s iron-shod hoofs was in her
ears like the roar of the spring freshets when the
empty ca&ntilde;ons poured their temporary torrents
down the Rockface into the Valley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>She knew he was running as she had never
ridden before. She had never called upon him
before. It was like being adrift upon the wind.
She heard the note of his speed rising in her
ears. It was as it had ever been, save that it was
a higher note, thinner, sharper. There was scarce
a sense of touch beneath her, a lack of jar, of
vibration, so evenly and smoothly did the shining
hoofs take the grassy plain.</p>
<p>Tears were in her eyes. Laughter was on her
lips. This was speed indeed! She had a sick
longing that Jim Last might see his two loved
ones go!</p>
<p>Then she gathered herself to turn her head
across her leaning shoulder and look back.</p>
<p>As her eyes swept into focus behind, the laughter
slipped off her lips as if wiped by an invisible
hand.</p>
<p>There, the same distance away as when they
started, rode Courtrey!</p>
<p>No farther away!</p>
<p>Bolt, shining in the sun, was keeping pace with
El Rey!</p>
<p>Farther back&ndash;&ndash;a little farther back&ndash;&ndash;was
Arrow, running magnificently, too.</p>
<p>A greater distance behind the two came
Slingshot.</p>
<p>Tharon was frightened. Not for herself. Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
for the intent of the men who came after her.
Not for gun-fire, nor for capture.</p>
<p>She was afraid for the king! Afraid that Bolt
could hold that wonderful pace! Then a surging
rage rose and sickened her.</p>
<p>She leaned down again and called once more
into the stallion&#8217;s ear and once more the note
rose a notch. She felt that great pulsing seeming
of reserve. Always when she called there was
the answer. The plain swam beneath her like a
blur. The thunder of the king&#8217;s hoofs was a single
note also.</p>
<p>Then Tharon raised her eyes and saw that she
had left the open land behind. The mountains
were rising swiftly before, she was sweeping up
their skirts. Trees flew by. She heard the singing
of waters. The forests seemed to come
down out of the skies to meet her, dark, forbidding.</p>
<p>She felt a sense of disaster, of helplessness.
Where was she going, she and El Rey, with her
enemies behind and coming fast? What was to
be the end of the race? And then, all suddenly,
the woods seemed to fall away on either side, a
gateway to open up before her. A lovely open
glade spread into the heart of the forest and the
great king thundered in between the guarding
pines. Like a silver flame he shot up the sloping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
floor, slowed, changed and came to stop before a
cabin that sat securely at the glade&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>With the crashing pound of El Rey&#8217;s ploughing
hoofs upon the very stones at the step, a man
came quickly from the interior of the cabin and
stepped out, his hand lifted.</p>
<p>Tharon Last, her hair beating on her shoulders,
her face pale as ashes, her breast heaving, looked
back toward the opening in the trees, and saw
Courtrey swing in a wide arc and circle past to
disappear toward the north.</p>
<p>After him swept his two lieutenants, to fade
swiftly from sight behind the shielding forest.</p>
<p>A grim expression spread over the face of the
man at the step as he, too, beheld the end of the
vital play.</p>
<p>Then he looked up at the girl on the silver
stallion and his dark eyes were alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>Then Tharon seemed to become conscious of
him for the first time.</p>
<p>She looked down at him and the black pupils
were spread across the azure of her eyes, making
them strangely exciting in their straight glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; she said, panting, &#8220;is some of the law
of Lost Valley. Courtrey&#8217;s law. That is the
man I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to kill some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset felt the blood flow back upon his heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
an icy flood. The words were simple, sincere,
unconscious of dramatic effect. They were as final
as death itself, and he dropped his eyes unconsciously
to the two guns at her hips. He wondered
why she had ridden without a shot this time.</p>
<p>He found his lips suddenly dry and moistened
them before he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, and his voice sounded
strange to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Tharon simply, &#8220;because he
kissed me&ndash;&ndash;once&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; shot my daddy&ndash;&ndash;in th&#8217; back,
th&#8217; hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said Kenset</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence while a bird
called sharply from a pine top and the voice of
the little stream became subtly audible.</p>
<p>It seemed to the man that all his values of life
had suddenly become shifted, changed. The commonplace
had become the unreal, the unlikely the
familiar.</p>
<p>Guns and threats and racing horses with a
woman for prize became on the moment natural
events in this hidden setting.</p>
<p>And what a woman she was! He looked up in
her face again and saw there sweetness and
strength, and grim purpose beyond his conception.
He knew that her words were downright, and that
they meant no more to her than duty to be done,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
a conscience cleared of debt. He glanced at the
hand lying so quietly on the pommel and thought
of it as stained with blood. At the fancy he
frowned and mentally shook himself.</p>
<p>Then, with an impulse wholly beyond his command,
he reached up and laid his own hand over
that one on the pommel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Last,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;I have no
words to express what I feel this moment about
Lost Valley and its people. Will you get down
and let me show you my house, here in my glade?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon sat quietly for a moment and looked
down at him. She did not remove her hand from
under his, neither did she seem to be conscious
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; she asked presently, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t owe me anything. I sent you away from my
house. I wouldn&#8217;t have come here if I&#8217;d known
where I was goin&#8217;. It was a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted. And yet I want you to come across
my threshold, to sit in my big chair. Will you
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Never in her life had the girl heard so low a
voice. It was soft and gentle, yet full of a vibrant
quality that belied its softness. The man himself
was unlike Lost Valley men. He wore the olive
drab trousers of the semi-military uniform, the
leather leggings, a tan leather belt and a soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
woolen shirt of the same drab color. It lay open
at the throat, and the base of his strong neck
was white as a woman&#8217;s. The dark eyes upturned
to hers were deep and winning. The
dark beard showed through his sharply shaven
cheeks where the red blood pulsed, like dusky
shadows.</p>
<p>A strange man, surely.</p>
<p>Tharon wondered what made him so different
from other men she had known. There was Billy
who had come into Lost Valley from somewhere
&#8220;below,&#8221; and Conford, and Curly. Jack Masters
had been born in the Valley. So had Bent Smith.
These men were her men, like herself and Jim
Last. This man was from &#8220;below,&#8221; too, yet he
was unlike.</p>
<p>While she studied him he met her glance with
the same grave look.</p>
<p>Presently, without a word, she swung herself
from the saddle, dropped El Rey&#8217;s rein, and
stepped around his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said briefly, &#8220;but I won&#8217;t
stay any longer than I let you stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Kenset laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think you let me exceed that limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way to the door, stepped back and
let her enter. As she did so she passed close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
him and caught the scent of him, the clean soft
smell of shaving soap, blended with the aroma of
good tobacco.</p>
<p>That, too, was different.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin there was a sense of comfort,
of brightness. The long pennants, like captured
rainbows, tacked to the rough walls, the soft
toned prints, the gay cushions, all these lent an
air of permanence, of home, that she had never
before seen in a man&#8217;s cabin. She stood and looked
all around with that same half-insolent stare which
had greeted Kenset at the Holding that memorable
day.</p>
<p>Then she went slowly forward and sat down in
the big chair by the table.</p>
<p>The man stood in her presence for a moment,
thereby giving a subtle effect of deference which
was not wholly lost upon Tharon, though she
would have been at a loss to define it.</p>
<p>Then, he, too, sat down on the edge of the
table desk in the corner, and with folded arms
waited while she finished her scrutiny of the
interior.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud of my home, Miss Last,&#8221; he said
presently. &#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Tharon slowly, &#8220;that it looks
like there&#8217;s a woman somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time Kenset laughed in earnest, a ringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
peal that startled El Rey at the doorstep, and
made him clink his bit-chains.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;assuredly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon turned her head and looked quickly
over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There in my big chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;I meant a woman livin&#8217; here, th&#8217; woman
who owns the pretties.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she waved a hand at the gay furnishings.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kenset, &#8220;these are all my own
pretties. I have books, as you see, and my maps
and several more pictures to put up, not to mention
some Mexican pottery that I brought from
Ciudad Juarez, and my chiefest treasure, a tapestry
from France. That last I can&#8217;t decide upon.
I have two splendid spaces&ndash;&ndash;over there between
the northern windows, facing the door, and yonder
at the end. Perhaps you will be good enough to
help me choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a boyish eagerness in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you? After a while, I mean, when you
have rested from your ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rested?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon looked at him in wonder. That ride
had been like wine to her, a stimulant, a thing
that sent the blood pounding in her veins.</p>
<p>Over the excitement had fallen a subtle shade,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
however, a hush, with the sight of Bolt so close
behind El Rey. If it had not been for that grave
thing she would have felt like a wound-up spring,
intent with energy, filled with action. She was
always so when El Rey ran beneath her. And this
stranger spoke of rest! Tharon Last could ride
all day without a thought of rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you if I can. But
what&#8217;s this thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sort of picture,&#8221; replied Kenset quickly, &#8220;a
picture woven in cloth. But first, if you&#8217;ll be so
kind, I want you to break bread with me. You
said we would not be friends. I&#8217;m not so sure of
that. There is nothing like a man&#8217;s bread and salt
for the refutation of logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slipped off the desk with a lithe rippling of
his body, but Tharon was first on her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean stay to supper?&#8221; she asked decisively.
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that. I took back a meal
from you. That stan&#8217;s between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you funny girl,&#8221; said Kenset, &#8220;nothing
stands between. And I don&#8217;t mean supper, exactly,
either. Please sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon stood, considering. She turned the
matter over in her mind.</p>
<p>She had taken this man&#8217;s house by storm. It
had, indeed, given her refuge. If it had not been
for the glade in the pines, she wondered where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
she would be now&ndash;&ndash;driven deep into Black Coulee,
she made no doubt, a prisoner to Courtrey.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay. But
you must be quick. Th&#8217; time is goin&#8217; fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset went swiftly across the cabin to that
part which served as kitchen, and took from a
curtain-covered set of shelves, a shiny nickel object
on spindly legs, which he brought and placed near
Tharon on the table.</p>
<p>He struck a match and presently a clean blue
flame grew up beneath it.</p>
<p>He lifted the lid and filled the small pot, thereby
exposed, with water from the bucket on a bench.
Then he delved in one of the big trunks against
the farther wall and brought out a little tin of
cakes, such as one could buy in any city of the
world.</p>
<p>All this was absorbing to the girl in the big
chair, who watched with grave eyes. And Kenset
kept up a running stream of gay talk all the time.
He wanted to make her at ease, to cover the
thought of the strain between them, and how much
he wanted to drive from his own mind the knowledge
that this sweet and wholesome creature was a
potential murderer, he did not know. From a can
he measured chocolate. From a pan somewhere
outdoors he brought milk. Sugar he added carefully
as a woman, and presently he spread between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
them on the table a small repast that was strange
to this girl of the wilderness.</p>
<p>He watched her with appraising eyes and saw
that there was in her no consciousness of the
unusual. She might have sat at meat in the big
room of the Holding for all the flutter there was
in her.</p>
<p>He told her somewhat of himself, of his life
in the East, but he was careful not to ask about
Lost Valley, to make mention of the circumstances
that had brought her to his door. And so an
hour passed as if it had been a bagatelle. The
afternoon was waning when Tharon rose swiftly
and abruptly terminated this first visit inside his
home of any Lost Valley denizen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring out your picture,&#8221; she said decisively,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you hang it, an&#8217; then I must go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Kenset dived once more into the mysterious
recesses of the trunk and this time brought out a
thing of rare beauty and value, a large tapestry,
some four by six feet in size, a wonderful thing
of soft and deathless hues, of cunning distances, of
Greek figures and leaning trees, of sea-line so faint
as to be almost lost in the misty skies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Tharon Last with an intake of
her breath, &#8220;Oh, where do they make such
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far on the other side of the world,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Kenset gently, pleased with the wonder in her wide
eyes, the evident and quick realization of beauty.</p>
<p>She whirled from it and glanced quickly at the
two spaces on the rugged walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said, pointing to the broad expanse
between the northern windows, &#8220;hang it
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; said Kenset, and went promptly for
a hammer.</p>
<p>When the huge thick mat was securely stretched
in place, Tharon helping to hold it while he
pounded in the broad-topped tacks, Kenset stepped
back and wondered how he had ever for a moment
considered hanging it in any other spot. The
tempered light from the door came in upon it,
bringing out each enchanted charm, each tender
vista.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I never
knew how lovely it was amid conventional surroundings!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; asked Tharon.</p>
<p>The man laughed in spite of himself and turned
his eyes to hers, to lose his quick amusement in
the earnest blue depths that seemed to question
him at every angle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that it looks better here in my cabin
than it ever did on city walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know. Contrast, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon stood a moment thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she answered slowly, &#8220;yes, perhaps.
I guess that&#8217;s why you seem so diff&#8217;rent to
me. Jim Last used to say that was why th&#8217; Valley
was so soft-like an&#8217; lovely, contrasted by th&#8217;
Rockface.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I seem different to you?&#8221; asked Kenset
quickly. &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t know how. You seem soft, like
a woman&ndash;&ndash;some women&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m afraid&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly, abruptly halted in her
na&iuml;ve speech, as if she had come face to face with
something she had not meant to meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; probed the man gravely, &#8220;go on.
You are afraid&ndash;&ndash;of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;I won&#8217;t say it&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do. I want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; answered the girl straightly, after the
honest and downright fashion of all her dealings,
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you are&ndash;&ndash;are too soft. You don&#8217;t
pack a gun. I&#8217;m afraid you wouldn&#8217;t use it if you
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a certain finality about the short
speech, as if she had put the last word of condemnation
to his estate.</p>
<p>Kenset looked down at his hands, spread them
out a bit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said shortly, though his
voice was still gentle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t. And I wouldn&#8217;t.
Not until the last extremity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what would that be?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just know, Miss Last,&#8221; he answered
smiling and raising his eyes once more to hers, &#8220;it
would have to be&ndash;&ndash;the <i>last</i> extremity, I know.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hands of all my forbears have been
clean, so far as I know. I have a deep horror of
that imaginary stain which human blood seems
to leave on the hands of the killer. Blood
guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call it that? My daddy had his killin&#8217;s,
but they were all in fair-an&#8217;-open. <i>I</i> called him a
<i>man</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a ringing quality in her voice, a
depth and resonance that spoke of war and heroes.
The fire that all the Holding knew was suddenly
in her eyes, flashing and flaming. Kenset caught
it, and a thrill shot through him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;But is there
only <i>one</i> type of man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said he, and for the life of him
he did not know why.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; said Tharon honestly.</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a pregnant moment,
while a silence fell on the cabin and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
could hear the singing water running down the
slopes.</p>
<p>Then the girl stooped and rearranged the
cushion in the big chair, laid a book more neatly
on top of another at the table&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; time is up,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must be goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She straightened her shoulders and looked at
him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for th&#8217; meal,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217;
some day I&#8217;ll return it&ndash;&ndash;in some manner. I don&#8217;t
know yet just what you&#8217;re here for, nor if you&#8217;re
Courtrey&#8217;s man or not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; ejaculated Kenset, but she went
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t shake hands with you, for whilst I
ain&#8217;t done no killin&#8217; yet, I&#8217;m sworn&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; Jim Last&#8217;s
hands was red&ndash;&ndash;they would be to such as you&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
down to th&#8217; last drop o&#8217; blood, th&#8217; last beat o&#8217;
my heart, I&#8217;m Jim Last&#8217;s girl&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; best gun man
in Lost Valley, if I do say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she swung quickly to the door.</p>
<p>Kenset followed her. He longed for words, but
found none.</p>
<p>There was a sudden tragic seeming in the very
air, a change from the pleasant commonplace to
the tense and unexpected. It was always so in
these strange meetings with the people of Lost
Valley, it seemed, as if he was never to find his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
way among them, the sane and quiet course that
he must travel.</p>
<p>As they reached the step at the door sill El Rey
stamped and whinnied a shrill blast. In through
the gateway between the pines there came a
rider on a running horse, Billy on Golden who
ploughed to a stop before them, his grey eyes
troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Billy,&#8221; said Tharon. &#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been lookin&#8217; for you,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;We
saw Courtrey an&#8217; his ruffians ridin&#8217; up east&ndash;&ndash;watched
&#8217;em with th&#8217; glass, an&#8217; Anita said you
rode south. Thought you might have met &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t meet &#8217;em, so to speak,&#8221; she said,
smiling, &#8220;though if I&#8217;d been on anythin&#8217; but El
Rey I would. They tried to drive me into Black
Coulee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; said Billy softly.</p>
<p>Then the Mistress of Last&#8217;s remembered her
manners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I make you acquainted with
Kenset of th&#8217; foothills. I rode in here just in
time to shake th&#8217; Stronghold bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men spoke, reached to shake each
other&#8217;s hands, and took a long survey that was
mutual. As the two pairs of eyes met, a wall
seemed to rear itself between them, a mist, a
curtain, something intangible, but there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>They looked across the woman&#8217;s shoulder, and
from that moment she was to stand between,
though what there could be in common between
the man in the U.&nbsp;S. service and the common rider
from Last&#8217;s was not apparent. El Rey was eager
for flight and by the time Tharon&#8217;s foot was in
the stirrup he was up on his hind feet, fore feet
beating the air, silver mane like a flying cloud.
The girl rose with him gracefully, threw her leg
across the saddle, waved a hand to Kenset in the
door, and in another moment they were gone
away down the grassy slope, out through the
opening, had stretched away along the oak-dotted
plain, swung toward the north, and were out of
sight.</p>
<p>The forest man turned away from the doorway,
stood a moment looking over the cabin
where the late light was making golden patterns
on the green and brown rug, sighed and reached
for his pipe.</p>
<p>Somehow all the spirit seem to have gone from
the summer day. The long twilight was setting
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t shake hands,&#8221; he muttered to
himself, &#8220;and what she said was true as death.
She&#8217;s <i>sworn</i>&ndash;&ndash;and it is a solemn oath to her. God
help the man who killed her daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then once more he sighed, unconsciously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Lord God help her!&#8221; he finished very
gravely, &#8220;she is so sweet&ndash;&ndash;so wild and spirited
and sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon and Billy let the horses run. Golden
was a racer himself, though he could not hold a
candle to the silver king, and the two young
creatures atop were free as the summer winds,
as buoyant and filled with joy of being. So they
shot down along the levels, Tharon holding El
Rey up a bit, though it was a man-size job to do
so, and Billy&#8217;s rein swinging loose on Golden&#8217;s
neck. They passed the last of the scattered oaks,
came out to the green stretches. The sun was
swinging like a copper ball above the Wall at the
west. Down through the ca&ntilde;ons the light came in
long red shafts that cut through the cobalt
shadows like sharp lances of fire and reached half
across Lost Valley. All the western part of the
Valley lay in that blue-black shadow. They could
see Corvan set like a dull gem in the wide green
country, the scattered ranches, miles apart.</p>
<p>They swung down to the west a bit, for Tharon
said she wanted to go by the Gold Pool and see
how it was holding out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;she&#8217;s deep as she ever
was at this time of year, an&#8217; cold as snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where one tall cottonwood stood like a sentinel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
in the widespread landscape they drew rein
and dismounted. Here a huge boulder cropped
from the plain and under its protecting bulk there
lay as lovely a spring as one would care to see,
deep and golden as its name implied, above its
swirling sands, for the waters were in constant
turmoil as they pressed up from below.</p>
<p>The girl lay flat at its edge and with her face
to the crystal surface, drank long and deeply.</p>
<p>As she looked up with a smile, Billy Brent felt
the heart in him contract with a sudden ache.</p>
<p>Her fresh face, its cheeks whipped pink under
their tan by the winds, its blue eyes sparkling, its
wet red lips parted over the white teeth, hurt him
with a downright pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tharon,&#8221; he said with an accent that was
all-revealing, &#8220;Oh, Tharon, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl scrambled to her feet and looked at him
in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said sharply, &#8220;what&#8217;s th&#8217; matter
with you? Are you sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the boy with conviction, &#8220;I am.
Let&#8217;s go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick, how?&#8221; she pressed, with the born tyranny
of the loving woman, &#8220;have you got that
pain in your stomach again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy laughed in spite of himself, and the
romantic ache was shattered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of Pete!&#8221; he complained, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you ever forget that? You know I&#8217;ve never et
an ounce of Anita&#8217;s puddin&#8217;s since. No, I think,&#8221;
he finished judiciously as he mounted Golden,
&#8220;that I&#8217;ve caught somethin&#8217;, Tharon&ndash;&ndash;caught
somethin&#8217; from that feller of th&#8217; red-beet badge.
Leastways I&#8217;ve felt it ever sence I left th&#8217; clearin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as they swung away from the spring toward
the Holding, far ahead under its cottonwoods,
he let out the young horse for another
stretch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet Golden can beat El Rey up home,&#8221; he
said over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beat th&#8217; king?&#8221; cried Tharon aghast, &#8220;you&#8217;re
foolin&#8217;, Billy, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t want to run nohow. I&#8217;ve
run enough this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the rider held up again and together they
paced slowly up through the gathering twilight
where long blue shadows were reaching out to
touch them from the western Wall and the golden
shafts were turning to crimson, were lifting as the
sun sank, were travelling up and up along the
eastern mountains toward the pale skies. Soon
they rode in purple dusk while the whole upper
world was bathed in crimson and lavender light
and Lost Valley lay deep in the earth&#8217;s heart, a
sinister spot, secret and dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, Billy,&#8221; said Tharon softly, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
like to ride like this, in th&#8217; big shadows&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
then I like to have some one with me that I know,
some one like you, some one who will understand
when I don&#8217;t talk, an&#8217; who is always there beside
me. It&#8217;s a wonderful feelin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;but somehow, it&#8217;s
soft, too&ndash;&ndash;mebby too soft&ndash;&ndash;like&ndash;&ndash;like&ndash;&ndash;like a
woman who&#8217;s just a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy swallowed once, miserably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always, Tharon,&#8221; he said huskily, &#8220;always&ndash;&ndash;when
you want me&ndash;&ndash;or need me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll be there,
beside you. An&#8217; you don&#8217;t need to even speak a
word to me. I&#8217;m like th&#8217; dogs&ndash;&ndash;there whether
you call or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the girl, and reaching over she
caught the rider&#8217;s hand, brown beneath its vanity
of studded leather cuff, and gave it a little tender
pressure.</p>
<p>Billy set his teeth to keep from crushing her
fingers, and together they rode slowly up along
the sounding slopes to the beautiful security and
comfort of Last&#8217;s Holding.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE SHOT IN THE CA&Ntilde;ONS</h3>
</div>
<p>Kenset of the foothills was very busy.
Between study of his maps and the endless
riding of their claimed areas he was out
from dawn till dark.</p>
<p>He found, indeed, that none but he, of late
years, had ridden those sloping forest covered
skirts. Some one, sometime, must have done so,
else the maps themselves would not have been, but
what marks they must have left were either gone
through the erosion of the elements or been wantonly
destroyed.</p>
<p>He fancied the former had been the case, for
he saw no signs of destruction, and the very curiosity
of the denizens of the Valley precluded
familiarity with forest work.</p>
<p>So he laid out for himself the labour of a
dozen men and went at it with a vim that kept
him at high tension. Therefore he had little
time to think of Tharon Last and the strange life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
in Lost Valley. Only when he rode between given
points, unintent on the land around, did he give
up to his speculations. At such times his mind
invariably went back to that first day at Baston&#8217;s
steps and he saw her again as he had seen her
then, tense, stooping, her elbows bent above the
guns at her hips, coming backward along the
porch, feeling for the steps with her foot.</p>
<p>Always he saw the ashen whiteness of her
cheeks beneath her blowing hair.</p>
<p>Always he frowned at the memory and always
he felt a thrill go down his nerves. What was
she, anyway, this wild, sweet creature of the
wilderness who held herself aloof from his friendship,
and said that she was &#8220;sworn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset, sane, quiet, peace loving, shook himself
mentally and tried not to think of her. But day
after day he came down along the edges of the
scattered woods where the cattle grazed&ndash;&ndash;on the
forest lands&ndash;&ndash;and looked over to where the Holding
lay like a greener spot on the green stretches.</p>
<p>He thought of her, living in this feudal hold,
mistress of her riders, her cattle, and her wonderful
racing horses of the Finger Marks, sweet, fair,
wholesome&ndash;&ndash;with the six-guns at her slender hips!</p>
<p>If only he, Kenset, could take those weapons
from her clinging hands, could wipe out of her
young heart the calm intent to kill!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>It was preposterous! It was awful!</p>
<p>Bred to another life, another law, another type
of woman, he could not reconcile this girl of
Lost Valley with anything he knew.</p>
<p>He went over in his mind again and again the
serene calmness of her in his cabin that day of the
race with Courtrey, and shook his head in puzzlement.</p>
<p>But why should he trouble himself about her at
all?</p>
<p>He had come here in his Government&#8217;s service
to reclaim its forest, to look after its interest.</p>
<p>Why should he bother with the moral code of
Lost Valley?</p>
<p>But reason as he might, the face of Tharon Last
came back to haunt him, waking or asleep.</p>
<p>He knew that it troubled him and was, in a way,
ashamed. So he worked hard at his tasks, relocated
boundaries, marked them with a peculiar
blaze in convenient trees which looked something
like this:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_6' id='linki_6'></a>
<img src='images/illus-159.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 71px; height: 108px;' /><br />
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>and set up monuments with odd and undecipherable
hieroglyphics upon them.</p>
<p>And with each blaze, each mark and monument
and sign, he drew closer in about him the net of
suspicion and disapproval which was weaving in
Lost Valley, for there was not one but ran the
gamut of close inspection and speculation by
Courtrey&#8217;s men, by the settlers who came many
miles over from the western side of the Valley
for the purpose, and by Tharon&#8217;s riders.</p>
<p>Low mutters of disapproval growled in the
Valley.</p>
<p>Who was this upstart, anyway, to come setting
signs and marks in the land that had been theirs
from time immemorial? What mattered the little
copper-coloured badge on his breast? What mattered
it that he was beginning to send out word
of his desire to work with and for the cattlemen of
Lost Valley, the settlers, the homesteaders?</p>
<p>What was this matter of &#8220;grazing permits&#8221; of
which he had spoken at the Stronghold?</p>
<p>Permits?</p>
<p>They had grazed their cattle where and when
they chose&ndash;&ndash;and could&ndash;&ndash;from their earliest
memory.</p>
<p>They asked no leave from Government.</p>
<p>When Kenset rode into Corvan he was treated
with exaggerated politeness by those with whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
he had to deal, with utter unconsciousness by all
the rest. To cattleman and settler alike he was
as if he had not been.</p>
<p>None spoke to him in the few broad streets,
none asked him to a bar to drink.</p>
<p>Serene, quiet, soft spoken, he came and went
about his business, and sneers followed him
covertly.</p>
<p>It was not long after Tharon&#8217;s visit to the cabin
in the glade, that Kenset, riding alone along the
twilight land, passed close to the mouth of Black
Coulee one day at dusk. He rode loosely, slouching
sidewise in his saddle, for he had been to
Corvan for his monthly mail and a few supplies
tied in a bag behind his saddle, and he carried his
broad hat in his hand.</p>
<p>The little cool wind that blew in from the narrow
gorge of the Bottle Neck and spread out like
an invisible fan, breathed on his face with a grateful
touch. The day had been hot, for the summer
was opening beautifully, and he had ridden
Captain far. Therefore he jogged and rested, his
arms hanging listlessly at his sides, his thoughts
two thousand miles away.</p>
<p>At the mouth of Black Coulee where the sinister
split of the deep wash came up to the level, there
grew a fringe of wild poplar trees. They were
beautiful things, tall and straight and thickly covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
with a million shiny leaves that whirled and
rustled softly in the wind, showing all their soft
white silver sides when the breeze came up from
the south as it did this day. There was water in
Black Coulee, many small springs, not deep enough
nor steady enough to count for water in a range
country, but sufficient to keep the poplars growing
on the rim of the great wash, to stand them thick
on the caving sides. Whole benches of earth with
their trees upon them slipped down these sides
from time to time, making of the Coulee a mysterious
labyrinth of thickets and shelves, of winding
ways and secret places.</p>
<p>Kenset had heard a few wild stories about
Black Coulee. Sam Drake had talked a bit more
than most men of Lost Valley would have talked,
and he had listened idly.</p>
<p>Now as he rode up along the levels and neared
the dark mouth of the cut he studied it with
appraising eyes. It was sinister enough, in all
truth, a deep, dark place behind its veil of poplars,
secretive, hushed.</p>
<p>The red light that dyed Lost Valley so wondrously
at the hour of the sun&#8217;s sharp decline
above the peaks and ridges of the Ca&ntilde;on Country
was awash in all the great sunken cup, save at
the west under the Rockface where the shadows
were already dark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Kenset drank in the beauty of the scene with
smiling eyes. Already a love for this hidden
paradise had grown wonderfully in his heart. He
felt as if he had never lived before, as if he had
never known beauty.</p>
<p>And so, dreaming a little of other scenes, smiling
to himself, he jogged along on Captain and
was nearly past the frowning mouth of the Coulee,
when there came the sharp snap of a rifle in the
stillness, and Captain changed his feet, sagged and
quivered, then caught himself and leaped ahead.
For one amazed moment Kenset thought the horse
was hit. Then, as he straightened in his saddle
and dropped his hand to catch up his hanging rein,
he looked quickly down. Where he was accustomed
to the smooth feel of the pommel beneath
his palm there was a sharp raw edge. A splinter
of wood stood up and a small flare of leather hung
to one side.</p>
<p>A bullet, singing out of Black Coulee, had carried
away part of the pommel.</p>
<p>Kenset shut his lips in a new line, gathered up
his rein and drew the horse down to a walk with
an iron hand.</p>
<p>Slowly, without a backward glance, he rode
on across the darkening levels. He was no
fool.</p>
<p>He knew he had had his warning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>Very well. He would give back his acceptance
of that warning.</p>
<p>He had said to Courtrey that night at the
Stronghold that he had come to stay.</p>
<p>No bunch of lawless bullies were going to scare
him out.</p>
<p>No other shot followed. He had not expected
one.</p>
<p>For a time after that he went about his work
as usual. Nothing happened; he had no outward
sign of the distaste with which he was regarded by
all factions alike, it seemed.</p>
<p>He met Courtrey face to face in Corvan one
day and spoke to him civilly, but Courtrey
did not speak. Wylackie Bob did, however&ndash;&ndash;a
sneering salutation that was a covert insult.
Kenset touched his hat with dignity and passed
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all th&#8217; tenderfeet!&#8221; said Baston, watching
the small by-play. &#8220;I b&#8217;lieve you could spit
on him, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; spoke up Old Pete, shuffling by on
his bandy legs, &#8220;sometimes that quiet, soft-spoken
kind rises&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; then hell&#8217;s to pay in their veecinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wylackie looked at the weazened snow-packer
with his snake-like eyes and snapped out
a warning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks takes sides too quick, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Old Pete went on about his business. He
knew, as did all the Valley, that a price was on his
head with Courtrey&#8217;s band for the daring leap
which had saved the life of Tharon Last that day
in spring.</p>
<p>Sooner or later that price would be paid, but
Old Pete was true western stuff. He had lived
his life, had had his day, and he was full of pride
at the turn of fate which had made him a hero in
a way at the end.</p>
<p>All the Valley stood off and admired Jim Last&#8217;s
daughter.</p>
<p>Pete basked in the reflected light. And Tharon
herself had taken his gnarled old hand one day
in Baston&#8217;s store and called him a thoroughbred.</p>
<p>Folks in Lost Valley were chary of words, conservative
to the last degree. That simple word,
the handclasp, the look in the clear blue eyes,
had been his eulogy.</p>
<p>It was whispered about, as was every smallest
happening, and came to the ears of Courtrey himself,
who had promised those vague things for the
future on the fateful night. But Courtrey was
playing a waiting game. He was obsessed with
the image of Tharon. Sooner or later he meant
to have her, to install her at the Valley&#8217;s head.
He had always had what he wanted. Therefore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
he expected to have this girl with the challenging
eyes, the maddening mouth, like crimson sumac.</p>
<p>Ellen?</p>
<p>Already he was setting in motion a thing that
was to take care of Ellen.</p>
<p>The thing in hand now was to placate Tharon,
the mistress of Last&#8217;s, to play the overwhelming
lover.</p>
<p>Courtrey knew better than to go near the Holding.
Bully that he was he yet had sense enough
to know that no fear of him dwelt in the huge old
house under the cottonwoods. If Tharon herself
did not shoot him, one&ndash;&ndash;or all&ndash;&ndash;of her riders
would. The day of the armed band riding down
to take her was, if not past, passing fast. He
recalled the look of the settlers&ndash;&ndash;poor spawn
that he hated&ndash;&ndash;whirling their solid column behind
her to face him that day from the Cup Rim&#8217;s
floor.</p>
<p>No. Courtrey meant to have the girl some day&ndash;&ndash;to
hold in his arms that ached for her loveliness,
the strong, resistant young body of her&ndash;&ndash;to
sate his thief&#8217;s mouth with kisses. But he would
call her to him of her own will, would taste the
savage triumph of seeing her come suing for his
mercy.</p>
<p>If Tharon meant to break Courtrey, he meant
no less to break her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>Outlawry&ndash;&ndash;mob law&ndash;&ndash;they were pitted against
each other.</p>
<p>And, lifting its head dimly through the smother
of hatred, of wrong, of repression and reprisal,
another law was struggling toward the light in
Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;the sane, quiet law of right and
equality, typified by the smiling, dark-eyed man of
the cabin in the forest glade.</p>
<p>Courtrey sent word to Tharon&ndash;&ndash;an illy spelled
letter, mailed at Baston&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;that he had meant
nothing by that race above the Black Coulee, except
another kiss. There was Courtrey&#8217;s daring
in the affronting words.</p>
<p>She sent the letter back to him&ndash;&ndash;riding in on
El Key alone&ndash;&ndash;with the outline of a gun traced
across it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; little wildcat!&#8221; grinned the man, &#8220;she&#8217;s
sure spunky!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Once again Tharon met Kenset in the days that
followed. Riding by the Silver Hollow she
stopped one breathless afternoon, drank of the
snow-cold waters, shared them with El Rey,
dropped the rein over the stallion&#8217;s head and flung
herself full length on the earth beside the spring.
A clump of willow trees grew here, for every
spring in Lost Valley had its lone sentinels to call
its presence across the stretching miles. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
girl lay flat on her back with her hands beneath
her head, she looked up into the blue heart of the
arching skies where the fleecy white clouds sailed,
and a sense of sweetness and peace came down
upon her like a garment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure some lovely spot, Lost Valley,&#8221;
she said aloud, &#8220;an&#8217; no mistake. I know, more&#8217;n
ever as th&#8217; days go by that Jim Last was only
jokin&#8217; when he told me of those other places out
below, big as you, lovely as you. It just ain&#8217;t
possible. Is it, El Rey, old boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she moved a booted foot to the king&#8217;s
striped hoof and tapped it smartly.</p>
<p>El Rey, always aloof, always touchy, never
sure of temper, jumped and snorted. The girl
laughed and crossed her feet and fell to speculating
idly about the world that lay beyond Lost
Valley. Little she knew of it. Only the brief
words of her father from time to time, the
reluctant speech of Last&#8217;s riders, for the master
of the Holding had laid down the law concerning
this.</p>
<p>His daughter was of the Valley, content.
He meant her to be so always. The man who
had instilled into her young mind a discontent
with her environment, a longing for the &#8220;flesh-pots&#8221;
of the world as he had styled it once,
would have had short shrift at Last&#8217;s. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
would have received his time and &#8220;gone packing&#8221;
swiftly.</p>
<p>And Tharon was content.</p>
<p>Barring the loneliness that had come with Jim
Last&#8217;s death, she was well content.</p>
<p>So she lay by the willows and hummed a sliding
tune, a soft, sweet thing of minors and high notes
falling, like rippling waters, and lazily watched
the high white clouds sail by.</p>
<p>And as she lay she became conscious of something
else in the drowsing land beside herself and
her horse. She felt it first, this presence&ndash;&ndash;a thin,
dim vibration that sang in the earth beneath her.
It stopped the wordless song on her lips, stilled
the breath in her throat, set every nerve in her to
listening, as it were.</p>
<p>Presently she sat up and felt quickly for the
gun-butts in their scabbards. Then she parted the
willows and looked out over the rolling slopes and
levels. True enough. A horseman was coming
in from the west, making for the Silver Hollow,
but Tharon smiled and her fingers relaxed on the
gun. This man rode straight&ndash;&ndash;like a lance, she
thought&ndash;&ndash;and his mount was brown, a good-enough
common horse, but no steed of Lost Valley.</p>
<p>Captain lacked the fire, the ramping keenness
of the Ironwoods, the spirit and dash of the
Finger Marks. For a long time the girl in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
willows watched them. Then as they came near
she rose and caught El Rey&#8217;s bridle.</p>
<p>He was no gentleman, this big blue-silver king.
He was savage and wild and imperious. He hated
other horses with a quick hatred sometimes and
had been known to wreak this sudden rage upon
them in sickening fury.</p>
<p>So Tharon held him with a strong brown hand
wrapped in the chain below the Spanish spade bit
in his mouth. She stood beside him, waiting, a
slim, golden creature, tawny of hair and blue of
eye, and the great horse towered above her mightily,
his silver mane blowing up above his arching
neck in the little wind that came from the
south.</p>
<p>They made a picture that Kenset never forgot,
as he swung round the willows and faced them.</p>
<p>El Rey screamed and pounded with his striped
hoofs, but Tharon jerked him down with no gentle
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be still, you bully!&#8221; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Last!&#8221; cried the forest man,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to meet you!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the genuine delight of a boy in his
voice, and Tharon caught the note. The sweet,
disarming smile parted her lips and she was all
girl at the moment, artless, innocent, unstained
by the shadow of lawlessness and crime that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
seemed to ever hang above her in Kenset&#8217;s
thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly am.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung down, gave Captain a drink at the
edge of the spring farthest from El Rey, dropped
the rein when he had finished, and swung around
to face the girl. He took off his wide hat and
wiped his forehead with a square of linen finer
than anything of its kind she had ever seen.</p>
<p>Then he stood for a moment looking straight
into her eyes with his smiling dark ones. It
seemed to Tharon that this man was always
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your spring, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The Silver Hollow. Th&#8217; Gold Pool is
farther south toward th&#8217; Black Coulee. There
was another one, fine as this, perhaps a better one,
up on th&#8217; Cup Rim Range, but Courtrey blew her
up, damn him! She was called th&#8217; Crystal.&#8221;
Kenset caught his breath, mentally, all but physically,
and put up a hand to cover his lips.</p>
<p>This <i>was</i> another type of woman from any he
had ever met, in truth.</p>
<p>The oath, rolling roundly over her full red lips,
was as unconscious as the long breath that lifted
her breast at the memory of that outrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We replaced her with a well&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; it&#8217;s a corker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Mebby better than th&#8217; old Crystal, though she was
a lovely thing. As clear as&ndash;&ndash;as ice that&#8217;s frozen
hard without a ripple of white. You know that
kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Kenset gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; sighed Tharon, &#8220;she&#8217;s gone, an&#8217; there
ain&#8217;t no use cryin&#8217; over spilt milk. What you ben
a-doin&#8217; sence I helped you hang th&#8217; picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221; Kenset stepped aside.
&#8220;It is uncomfortable to stand through a visit&ndash;&ndash;and
I mean to have a long talk-fest with you, if
you will be so kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon flung herself down at the spring&#8217;s edge,
eased the right gun from under her hip, leaned
on her elbow and prepared to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire away,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kenset laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; he ejaculated, &#8220;I said
visit. That takes two. What have you been
doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, everythin&#8217;, mostly. Made a new shirt
for Billy, for one thing. An&#8217; I showed Courtrey
th&#8217; picture o&#8217; this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She patted the blue gun that lay half in her lap,
its worn scabbard black against her brown skirt.</p>
<p>Kenset sobered at once. As ever when he let
his mind dwell on that dark shadow which sat so
lightly on this girl, he had no feeling for mirth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>A very real chill went down his spine and he
looked intently into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tharon shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; you&#8217;d understand,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can show you something you will understand,&#8221;
he said, and reached for Captain&#8217;s bridle.
He pulled the horse around and pointed to the
saddle horn.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up quickly. With the sure instinct
of a dweller in a gun man&#8217;s land she knew the
meaning of the splintered wood of the pommel,
the torn and ragged leather that had covered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;where did you get
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the mouth of Black Coulee, at dusk a
week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long moment Tharon studied the saddle.
Then her gaze dimmed, lengthened, went beyond
into infinitude. The pupils of her eyes drew down
to tiny points of black against the brilliant blue.</p>
<p>At last she turned and held out a hand, rising
from her elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mister,&#8221; she said quaintly,
&#8220;fer that day at the Holdin&#8217; an&#8217; th&#8217; meal I offered
an&#8217; took, an&#8217; fer my words. I know now
that you are&ndash;&ndash;that you were&ndash;&ndash;straight. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
yet know what you may mean in Lost Valley with
your talk of Government, but I do know you ain&#8217;t
a Courtrey man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset took the hand. It was firm and shapely
and vibrant with the young life there was in her.
He laid his other one over it and held it in a
close clasp for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean only right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;sanity and law
and decency. I think I have a big problem to
handle here&ndash;&ndash;aside from my work on the forest&ndash;&ndash;a
problem I must solve before I can be effective
in that work&ndash;&ndash;and I am more sincerely glad than
I can say that my friend, the outlaw, took that
warning shot at me. It ruined a perfectly good
saddle, but it has made one point clear to you. I
am no Courtrey man, and that&#8217;s a solemn fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t ashamed to say I&#8217;m glad, too,&#8221;
said Tharon.</p>
<p>So, with the sun shining in the cloud-flecked
heavens and the little winds blowing up from the
south to ruffle the hair at the girl&#8217;s temples, these
two sat by the Silver Hollow and talked of a
thousand things, after the manner of the young,
for Kenset found himself reverting to the things
of youth in the light of Tharon&#8217;s grave simplicity.</p>
<p>They looked into each other&#8217;s eyes and found
there strange depths and lights. They were aliens,
strangers, groping dimly for a common ground,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and finding little, though presently they fell once
more upon the law in Lost Valley and earnestness
deepened into gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Last,&#8221; said Kenset, thrilling at his daring,
&#8220;why must this law dwell in these?&#8221; and
he reached a hand to tap the gun on her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? That very question&#8217;d show your ignorance
to any Lost Valley man. Because it&#8217;s all
there is. You&#8217;ve seen Courtrey. You&#8217;ve seen
Steptoe Service. Can&#8217;t you judge from them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, so far as they two go. A bad man
and a bad sheriff. But they are not all the officers
of this County. Where and who is your
Superior Judge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor ol&#8217; Ben Garland. Weaker&#8217;n skim milk.
Scared to say his soul&#8217;s his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was infinite scorn in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s Steptoe Service, or nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset thought a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the Coroner?&#8221; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Banner,&#8221; she answered quickly, &#8220;as
straight a man as ever lived. Brave, too. He&#8217;s
been shot at more&#8217;n once fer takin&#8217; exception to
some raw piece o&#8217; work in this Valley, fer pokin&#8217;
his nose in, so to speak. Jim Last used to say
he was th&#8217; only <i>man</i> at the Seat, which is Corvan,
you know, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;District Attorney?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Nord. Keen as a razor an&#8217; married to
Courtrey&#8217;s sister. Now do you see why this is
th&#8217; law?&#8221; She, too, tapped the gun.</p>
<p>Kenset frowned and looked down along the
green range. He thought of the unpainted pine
building in Corvan which was the Court House.
A strange personnel, truly, to invest it with
authortity!</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said briefly, &#8220;but there must be
some way out. This is not the right way, the way
that must come and last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon&#8217;s lips drew into the thin line that made
them like her father&#8217;s. &#8220;It&#8217;s th&#8217; law that&#8217;s here,&#8221;
she said and there was an instant coldness in her
voice, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s th&#8217; law that&#8217;ll last until Courtrey
or I go down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, watching, saw that thinning of the
lips, the hardening of all the young lines of her
face. He knew he had blundered. Talk was
cheap. It was action that counted in Lost Valley.</p>
<p>With a quick motion he reached over and caught
the girl&#8217;s hand and drew it to him, covering it
with both of his.</p>
<p>Her eyes followed, came to rest on his face,
cool, appraising, waiting.</p>
<p>She was, in all that had counted in his life,
crude, untutored, basic.</p>
<p>Yet that calm look made his impulsive action
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
seem unpardonable in the next second. However
a warm surge of feeling shot through him with
the quiet resting of that firm brown hand between
his own, and he held it tighter. Kenset had
thought he was sophisticated, that little or nothing
could stir him deeply&ndash;&ndash;not since Ethel Van Riper
had gone to Europe as the bride of the old Count
of Easthaven. That had been four years back.
He had been pretty young then, but the young feel
deeply.</p>
<p>Now he held a gun woman&#8217;s hand in the thin
shade of a willow clump in the heart of Lost
Valley&ndash;&ndash;and the blood surged in his ears, the levels
and slopes danced before his vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Tharon,&#8221; he said, for the first time
using her given name, &#8220;I beg your pardon. You
are strong, simple, serene. You know your land
and its ways. I am an alien, an interloper&ndash;&ndash;but
I can&#8217;t bear to think of you as waiting for the
time to kill a man&ndash;&ndash;or to be killed in the killing.
It sickens me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon snatched her hand from his and leaped
to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that!&#8221; she cried passionately,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear it! I thought you were a
real man, maybe, but you&#8217;re not! You&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re a
woman! A soft woman&ndash;&ndash;I hate th&#8217; breed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was flushed, for what reason Kenset,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
stunned by her vehement words, could not tell.
She flung the rein up and followed it, leaping to
saddle like a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tol&#8217; you we couldn&#8217;t be friends!&#8221; she cried,
her eyes blazing with sudden fire, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t no
manner of use a-tryin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset, springing forward, caught El Rey&#8217;s
bit. The stallion reared and struck, but he held
him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is use, Tharon,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;It&#8217;s vital!
Since that day on Baston&#8217;s steps, when you backed
out past me I have had you in my mind&ndash;&ndash;my
thoughts by day and night&ndash;&ndash;there is use, and I&#8217;ll
keep your hands from blood&ndash;&ndash;Courtrey&#8217;s or any
other&ndash;&ndash;if it takes my life&ndash;&ndash;so help me God!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl leaned down and her blue eyes blazed
in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; make me false to th&#8217; crosses on Jim
Last&#8217;s stone?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;not you or anybody
else&ndash;&ndash;could do that trick! Let go!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next moment she had whirled out from the
flickering shade of the willows and was gone
around toward the north&ndash;&ndash;there was only the
sound of hoofs ringing on the earth. Kenset, left
alone where the Silver Hollow bubbled softly
above its snowy sands, passed a trembling hand
across his eyes and stood as in a trance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>What did it mean? What had he promised?
What vital emotion had gripped him that his
usually quiet tongue had rushed into that torrential
speech that dealt with life and death? What was
Tharon Last to him?</p>
<p>A figure of the old West! A romantic gun
woman with her weapons on her hips! A rider
of wild horses!</p>
<p>Slowly, as if he had gained an added weight of
years, he reined Captain and swung himself up.
He rode east from the spring toward the lacy
and far-reaching skirts of the forest, and for the
first time he saw the rolling country with tragic
eyes.</p>
<p>It held deep issues&ndash;&ndash;life and death and the
passing or continuing of r&eacute;gimes and and dynasties&ndash;&ndash;but
it was a wondrous country, and, come good
or bad, it had become his own. He swung around
in his saddle and looked far back across the Valley.
He saw the golden light on its uncounted
acres, the shadow falling at the foot of the great
Rockface, the mighty Wall itself with the silver
ribbon of the Vestal&#8217;s Veil falling straight down
from the upper rim, the distant town, looking
always like a dull gem in a dark setting, and a
thrill shot to his heart.</p>
<p>Yes, if he lived to do his work in the hidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Valley&ndash;&ndash;if he was shot this night on his own
doorstep, it was his country.</p>
<p>He who was alien in every way, was yet native.</p>
<p>Something in the depths of him came down as
from far distant racial haunts and was at home.</p>
<p>So he rode slowly up among the scattered oaks
with his hands folded on the mutilated pommel,
and he knew that his lines were definitely cast.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Tharon Last rode into the Holding and dismounted
in unwonted silence.</p>
<p>There was a frown between her brows, an
unusual thing. She turned the stallion into his
corral, dragged off the big saddle to hang it on
its peg, flung the studded bridle on a post.</p>
<p>The men were not in yet. Far toward the north
beyond the big corrals she could see the cattle
grazing toward home. A surge of savage joy
in her possessions flooded over her. These things
were her own. They were what Jim Last had
worked for all his life.</p>
<p>Not one hoof or hide should Courtrey take
without swift reprisal.</p>
<p>Not one inch should he push her from her
avowed purpose&ndash;&ndash;not though all the strangers in
the world came to Lost Valley and prated of
blood-guilt.</p>
<p>But for some vague reason which she could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
have analyzed had she wished, she went to the
paled-in garden where the silver waters trickled
and searched among the few flowers growing there
for some blossom, sweeter, tenderer, more mild
and timid than usual for the pale hands of the
Virgin in the deep south room.</p>
<p>With the posy in her fingers she slipped quietly
to her sanctuary and knelt before the statue, pensive,
frowning, vaguely stirred. She whispered
the prayers that Anita had taught her, but she
found with a start that the words were meaningless,
that she was saying them mechanically.</p>
<p>Her mind had been at the Silver Hollow, seeing
again the forest man&#8217;s dark eyes, so grave, so
quiet, so deep&ndash;&ndash;her right hand was conscious as it
had never been in all her life before. She heard
a strange man&#8217;s condemning voice, felt the warmth
of his hands pressed upon hers.</p>
<p>The mistress of Last&#8217;s shook herself, both
mentally and physically, and set herself to resay
her prayers.</p>
<p>When she came out to the life and bustle of
the ranch house the cattle were streaming into the
far corrals under their dust, the riders were shouting,
young Paula sang in the kitchen, and Anita
passed back and forth about the evening meal.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There was a slim moon in the west above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
Ca&ntilde;on Country. The skies were softly alight,
high and vaulted, deep and mysterious and sweet.</p>
<p>World-silence, profound as eternity, hung
tangibly above Lost Valley and the Wall, the
eastern ramparts of the shelving mountains, the
rocklands at the north. There was little sound
in all this sleeping wilderness.</p>
<p>Bird life was rare. The waters that fell at
seasons from the open mouths of the ca&ntilde;ons half
way up the Rockface were dried. Down in the
Valley itself there could be seen the lights of
Corvan which never went out from dusk to dawn.
Far to the north a black blot might have been visible
with a fuller moon&ndash;&ndash;Courtrey&#8217;s herds bedded
on the range, the only stock in the Valley so
privileged.</p>
<p>Along the foot of the Rockface in the early
evening a tiny procession had crawled, three
burros, their pack-saddles empty save for a couple
of sacks tied across each, and a weazened form
that followed them&ndash;&ndash;Old Pete, the snow-packer,
bound on his nightly journey to the Ca&ntilde;on Country
for the bags of snow for the cooling of the
Golden Cloud&#8217;s refreshments.</p>
<p>He was a little old man, grotesque and misshapen,
yet he followed briskly after the burros,
which were the fastest travelers of their kind in
the land. He rolled on his bandy legs and kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the little animals on a constant trot with the wisp
of stick he carried and the deep, harsh cries that
heralded his coming for a mile ahead and sent the
echoes reverberating between the ca&ntilde;on walls. A
little north of Corvan he had followed the Rockface
close for a distance, then suddenly turned
back on his tracks and disappeared, burros and all.
This was the invisible entrance to the Ca&ntilde;on
Country, a narrow mouth that opened sidewise
into the very breast of the thousand-foot Wall
and led back along a thin sheet of rock that stood
between the gorge and the Valley. The floor
of this cut or ca&ntilde;on, which was so narrow that
the laden burros had a &#8220;narrow squeak&#8221; to pass,
as Pete said, lifted sharply. It rose smoothly
underfoot in the pitch darkness, for the cut was
roofed in the living rock five hundred feet above,
and climbed for a mile. It was a dead, flat place,
without sound, for the footsteps of the burros
and the man fell dully on the soft and sliding
floor, and it seemed to have no acoustic properties.</p>
<p>At the end of the mile this snake-like split in the
solid rock came suddenly out into a broader, more
steeply pitched ca&ntilde;on whose walls went straight
up to the open skies above. Here there were
heaps and piles and long slides of dead stone,
weathered and powdered, that had fallen from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
time to time from the parent walls. This in turn
led up and on to other breaks and splits and cuts,
all open, all lifting to the upper world, and all
as blind and dangerous to follow as any deathtrap
that old Dame Nature ever devised. Here,
at any crosscut, any debouching ca&ntilde;on, a man
might turn to his undoing, might travel on and
up and never reach those beckoning heights, seen
clearly from some blind pocket he had wandered
into, might never find his way back to the original
ca&ntilde;on among the continuous cuts that met and
crossed and passed each other among the towering
points and sheets.</p>
<p>But Old Pete knew where he was going. Not
for nothing had he threaded these passages for
fifteen years. He knew the Ca&ntilde;on Country for
the lower part better than any man in the Valley,
if Courtrey be excepted.</p>
<p>So this night he climbed and shouted to his
burros and thought no more of the sounding
splits, for here the echoes raved, than he would
have thought of the open plains below.</p>
<p>He passed on and up to where a certain cut
lay full, year after year, of packed and hardened
snow. For fifteen years Old Pete had visited this
cut, a deeper drop into the nether world of rock,
and cut his supplies from its surface. Every
season he took what he needed, leaving a widening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
circle at the edge from which he worked, where
the cut he traveled passed the mouth of the pent
ca&ntilde;on, and every year the snows, sifting from
high above, leveled it again. There was no known
outlet for this glacier-like pack, no sliding chance,
yet it was always on a certain level&ndash;&ndash;each summer
seeming to lose just what it gained in winter. It
lay level at the mouth of the passing cut, was
never filled higher.</p>
<p>Starting at dusk from Corvan, Pete reached his
destination around two o&#8217;clock, filled his sacks, tied
them on his mules and started down, coming out
of the Rockface in time to meet the dawn that
quivered on the eastern ramparts.</p>
<p>But this night Old Pete, sturdy, fearless, unarmed,
was not to see the accustomed pageant of
the rising sun, the fleeing veils of shadows shifting
on the Valley floor that he had watched with silent
joy for all these years.</p>
<p>This night he was well down along his backward
way, shouting in the darkness, for the slim moon
had dropped down behind the lofty peaks above,
when all the echoes in the world, it seemed, let
loose in the ca&ntilde;ons and all the weight of the
universe itself came pressing hard upon his dauntless
heart with the crack of a gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; price!&#8221; whispered Old Pete as he fell
sprawling on his face, &#8220;fer pure flesh!&#8221; With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
which cryptic word he bade farewell to the sounding
passes, the tenets of manhood as he conceived
them, the valour, and the grumbling at life in
general.</p>
<p>The little burros, placid and faithful, went on
and saw the pageant of the dawn from the hidden
gateway in the Wall, crept down the Rockface,
single file, and at their accustomed hour stood at
their accustomed place before the Golden Cloud.</p>
<p>It was Wan Lee, Old Pete&#8217;s <i>b&ecirc;te noir</i>, who
found them there and ran shouting through the
crowd of belated players in the saloon&#8217;s big room,
his pig-tail flying, his almond eyes popping, to
upset a table and batter on his master&#8217;s door and
scream that the &#8220;bullos&#8221; were here, &#8220;allesame
lone,&#8221; and that there was blood all spattered on
the hind one&#8217;s rump!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WHITE ELLEN</h3>
</div>
<p>So old Pete, the snow-packer, had paid the
price of gallantry. The bullet he had averted
from Tharon Last&#8217;s young head that day in
the Golden Cloud but sheathed itself to wait for
him. All the Valley knew it. Not a soul beneath the
Rockface but knew beyond a shadow of a doubt
who, or whose agents, had followed Pete that
night to the Ca&ntilde;on Country. Whispers went
flying about as usual, and as usual nothing
happened.</p>
<p>When the news of this came to Last&#8217;s Holding
the mistress sat down at the big desk in the living
room, laid her tawny head on her arms and wept.</p>
<p>There was in her a new softness, a new feeling
of misery&ndash;&ndash;as if one had wantonly killed a rollicking
puppy before her eyes. Those tears were Old
Pete&#8217;s requiem. She dried them quickly, however,
and set another notch to her score with Courtrey.</p>
<p>It was then that the waiting game ceased
abruptly.</p>
<p>Tharon, riding on El Rey, went in to Corvan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
She tied the horse at the Court House steps and
went boldly in to the sheriff&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Behind her were Billy, like her shadow, and
the sane and quiet Conford.</p>
<p>Steptoe Service, fat and important, was busy
at his desk. His spurs lay on a table, his wide hat
beside them. The star of his office shone on his
suspender strap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step Service,&#8221; said the girl straightly, &#8220;when
are you goin&#8217; to look into this here murder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Service swung round and shot an ugly look at
her from his small eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have already done so,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ben out an&#8217;
saw to th&#8217; buryin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buried him already? How dared you do
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Service, banging a fist on his table,
&#8220;I&#8217;m th&#8217; sheriff of Menlo County, young woman.
I ordered him buried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Jim Banner there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Banner&#8217;s sick in bed&ndash;&ndash;got th&#8217; cholery
morbus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon&#8217;s eyes began to blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; she snapped, &#8220;th&#8217; time&#8217;s ripe! Come
on, boys,&#8221; and she whirled from the Court House.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>As she ran across the street to where the Finger
Marks were tied, she came face to face with Kenset
on Captain.</p>
<p>Her face was red from brow to throat, her
voice thick with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You talked o&#8217; law, Mr. Kenset,&#8221; she cried at
the brown horse&#8217;s shoulder, her eyes upraised to
his, &#8220;an&#8217; see what law there is in Lost Valley!
Step Service has buried th&#8217; snow-packer&ndash;&ndash;without
a by-your-leave from nobody! Th&#8217; man&ndash;&ndash;or
woman&ndash;&ndash;that kills Courtrey now &#8217;counts for three
men&ndash;&ndash;Harkness, Last an&#8217; Pete. I&#8217;m on my way
to th&#8217; Stronghold.&#8221;</p>
<p>She whirled again to run for the stallion, but
the forest man leaned down and caught her
shoulder in a grip of steel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; he said in that compelling low
voice, &#8220;not now. I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to talk to you!&#8221; she flung
out, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Over her head Conford&#8217;s anxious eyes met
Kenset&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold her,&#8221; they begged plainly, &#8220;we can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Kenset held her, by physical strength.</p>
<p>The grey eyes of Billy were on him coldly. The
boy was hot with anger at the man. He put a
hand on Kenset&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go,&#8221; he said, but Kenset shook him off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come out on the plain a little way with me, all
of you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is no place to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon, standing where he had stopped her,
her breast heaving, her lips apart, seemed
struggling against an unknown force. She put up
a hand and tried to dislodge his fingers on her
shoulder, but could not.</p>
<p>Presently she wet her lips and looked around
the street, already filled with watching folk, then
up at Kenset.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can tell you something,&#8221; he answered
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said briefly, &#8220;let go an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word the man loosed her. She went
to El Rey and mounted.</p>
<p>Her riders mounted with her, Billy&#8217;s face
frowning and set. From the steps of Baston&#8217;s
store a few cowboys watched. There were no
Stronghold men in town, for it was too early in
the day.</p>
<p>In silence Kenset led out of town at a brisk
canter. His lips were set, his eyes very grave.</p>
<p>In the short gallop that followed while they
cleared the skirts of the town, he did some swift
thinking, settled some heavy questions for himself.</p>
<p>He was about to take a decided step, to put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
himself on record in something that did not concern
his work in the Valley.</p>
<p>He was going directly opposite to the teaching
of his craft. He was about to take sides in this
thing, when he had laid down for himself rigid
lines of non-partisanship. His mind was working
swiftly.</p>
<p>If he flung himself and his knowledge of the
outside world and the law into this thing he sunk
abruptly the thing for which he had come to Lost
Valley&ndash;&ndash;the middle course, the influence for order
that he had hoped to establish that he might do
his work for the Government.</p>
<p>But he could not help it. At any or all costs
he must stop this blue-eyed girl from riding north
to challenge Courtrey on his doorstep.</p>
<p>The blood congealed about his heart at the
thought.</p>
<p>Where the rolling levels came up to the confines
of the town they rode out far enough to be
safe from eavesdroppers, halted and faced each
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Last,&#8221; said Kenset gently, &#8220;I&#8217;m a
stranger to you. I have little or no influence with
you, but I beg you to listen to me. You say there
is no help for the conditions existing in Lost Valley.
That outrage follows outrage. True. I
grant the thing is appalling. But there is redress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
There is a law above the sheriff, when it can be
proven that that officer has refused to do his duty.
That law is invested in the coroner. Your coroner
can arrest your sheriff. He can investigate a
murder&ndash;&ndash;he can issue a warrant and serve it anywhere
in the State. He can subpoena witnesses.
Did you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor you?&#8221; he asked Conford.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew somethin&#8217; like that&ndash;&ndash;but what&#8217;s th&#8217;
use? Banner&#8217;s a brave man, but he&#8217;s got a family.
An&#8217; he&#8217;s been only one against th&#8217; whole push.
What could he do when there wasn&#8217;t another man
in th&#8217; Valley dared to stand behind him? You
saw what happened to Pete. He struck up Courtrey&#8217;s
arm when he shot at Tharon one night last
spring. Th&#8217; same thing&#8217;d happen to Banner if he
tried to pull off anythin&#8217; like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>A light flamed up in Kenset&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you, Miss Last,&#8221; he said straightly, &#8220;will
give me your word to do no shooting, something
like that will be pulled off here, and shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked directly at Tharon, and for the first
time in her life she felt the strength of a gaze
she couldn&#8217;t meet&ndash;&ndash;not fully.</p>
<p>But Tharon shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sworn,&#8221; she said simply.</p>
<p>Kenset&#8217;s face lost a bit of colour. Billy, watching,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
turned grey beneath his tan. He saw something
which none other did, a thing that darkened
the heavens all suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Kenset quietly, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to do
without your promise and go ahead anyway. We&#8217;ll
ride back to town, demand of Service a proper investigation
by a coroner&#8217;s jury, and begin at the
bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon moved uneasily in her saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doin&#8217; this?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Why
are you mixin&#8217; up in our troubles? Why don&#8217;t
you go back to your cabin an&#8217; your pictures an&#8217;
books an&#8217; things, an&#8217; let us work out our own
affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset lifted a quick hand, dropped it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he wheeled his horse and started for
Corvan, the others falling into line at his
side.</p>
<p>When Kenset, quietly impervious to the veiled
hostility that met him everywhere, faced Steptoe
Service and made his request, that dignitary felt
a chill go down his spine. Like Old Pete he felt
the man beneath the surface. He met him, however,
with bluster and refused all reopening of a
matter which he declared settled with the burial
of the snow-packer in the sliding ca&ntilde;ons where
he was found.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Kenset shortly, &#8220;you see I
have witnesses to this,&#8221; and he turned on his heel
and went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Last,&#8221; he said when they were in
the wholesome summer sunlight once more, &#8220;if
you have any friends whom you think would stand
for the right, send for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; Vigilantes,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;we&#8217;ll gather
them in twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Vigilantes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; settlers,&#8221; said Conford.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Until they are here we&#8217;ll guard
the mouth of this ca&ntilde;on that leads into the Rockface,
as I understand it. Now take me to this
man Banner.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a low, rambling house in the outskirts of
Corvan they found Jim Banner, sitting on the
edge of his bed, undeniably sick from some acute
attack. His eyes were steady, however, and he
listened in silence while Kenset talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;bring me my boots an&#8217;
guns. I been layin&#8217; for this day ever sence I been
in office. I wisht Jim Last was here to witness
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In two hours Kenset was on his way to the blind
mouth of the pass that led into the Ca&ntilde;on Country,
Tharon was shooting back to the Holding
on El Rey to put things on a watching basis there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
while Conford and Billy went south and west to
rouse the Vigilantes.</p>
<p>With Kenset rode Banner, weak and not quite
steady in his saddle, but a fighting man notwithstanding.</p>
<p>All through the golden hours of that noonday
while he jogged steadily on Captain, Kenset was
thinking. He had food for thought, indeed. He
carried a gun at last&ndash;&ndash;he who had ridden the Valley
unarmed, had meant never to carry one. He
felt a stir within him of savagery, of excitement.</p>
<p>He meant to have justice done, to put a hard
hand on the law of Lost Valley. Murders uninvestigated,
cattle stolen at will, settlers&#8217; homes
burned over their heads, their hearths blown up by
planted powder when they returned from any
small trip, their horses run off&ndash;&ndash;these things had
seemed to him preposterous, mere shadows of
facts. Now they were down to straight points
before him, tangible, solid. He got them from
the blue eyes of Tharon Last, the gun woman, and
he had taken sides! He who had meant to keep
so far out of the boiling turmoil.</p>
<p>He camped that night at the base of the Wall
where the blind door entered, made his bed just
inside the dead black passage, and watched while
Banner, weary and still weak, slept in his blankets
beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>This was new work for Kenset, strange work,
this waiting for men who called themselves the
Vigilantes&ndash;&ndash;for a slim golden girl who rode and
swore and pledged herself to blood!</p>
<p>More than once in the quiet night that followed,
Kenset wiped a hand across his brow and
found it moist with sweat.</p>
<p>What did he mean? Again and again he asked
himself that question.</p>
<p>What did he mean by Tharon Last? What was
this cold fire that burned him when he thought of
her pulling those sinister blue guns on Courtrey?
Did he fear to see her kill Courtrey&ndash;&ndash;to see that
shadowy stain on her hands&ndash;&ndash;or did he fear something
worse, infinitely worse&ndash;&ndash;to see Courtrey,
famous gun man, beat her to it!</p>
<p>He shuddered and sweat in the clear cold of the
starlit night and searched his bewildered heart.
He could find no answer save and except the weary
one that Tharon Last must be holden from her
sworn course.</p>
<p>Tharon Last who looked at him with those deep
blue eyes and spoke so coolly of this promised
killing! He recalled the earnest frown between
her brows, the simple directness of her duty as she
saw it and told it to him.</p>
<p>Either way&ndash;&ndash;either way&ndash;&ndash;she was lost to him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
forever&ndash;&ndash;There he caught himself and started all
over again.</p>
<p>What was she to him?</p>
<p>What could she ever be? She with her strange
soul, <i>her lack of soul</i>!</p>
<p>What did he want her to be? One moment
he ached with her loveliness&ndash;&ndash;the next he shuddered
at her savagery.</p>
<p>He did not want her to be anything! Why not
go out to the dim and half-remembered world that
he had left, the world of lights, padded floors and
marble steps, leave this impossible land with its
blood and wrongs? Nay, he could not leave Lost
Valley. He was as much a part of it as the grim
Rockface itself, the Vestal&#8217;s Veil eternally shimmering
in its thousand feet of beauty. Life or
death, for Kenset, it must be here.</p>
<p>So he waited and listened and watched the stars
wheeling in everlasting majesty, and he found his
hands falling now and again upon the gun-butts at
his sides!</p>
<p>Near dawn Banner awoke, refreshed and
stronger, and made him lie down for a few hours&#8217;
sleep.</p>
<p>When he awoke the sun was well up along the
heavens and Banner was offering him a piece of
dry bread and some jerky, spiced and smoked and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
as dry and sweet as anything he had ever eaten
in all his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re comin&#8217;,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;thar&#8217;s five
comin&#8217; from down along th&#8217; Wall at th&#8217; south&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;ll
be Jameson, Hill and Thomas, an&#8217; some
others&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I see about ten or twelve, near&#8217;s I
can make out, driftin&#8217; in from up toward th&#8217; Pomo
settlement. Thar&#8217;s a dust cloud movin&#8217; up from
th&#8217; Bottle Neck, too. They&#8217;ll be here by one
o&#8217;clock at th&#8217; furdest.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they were, a grim, silent group of men,
determined, watchful, bent on the second step of
the program to which they had pledged themselves
that night at Last&#8217;s Holding. Tharon was there,
too, and with her Bent Smith on Golden.</p>
<p>It was a goodly number who left their horses
in charge of Hill and Dixon at the blind mouth
and entered the long black cut. They climbed in
low spoken quiet, their voices sounding back upon
them with an odd dead effect. They went faster
than Old Pete was wont to travel, for they meant
to reach the spot of the tragedy before the early
shadows should begin to sift down from the high
world above. Tharon went eagerly, her eyes
dilated.</p>
<p>Always she had dreamed of the Ca&ntilde;on Country.
Always she had wondered what it was like.
When she left the mouth of the black roofed cut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
and came out into the narrow, rockwalled ca&ntilde;on
with its painted faces reaching up into the very
skies, she gasped with amaze. Above her head
she could see the endless cuts and crosscuts, the
standing spires and narrow wedgelike walls that
made a labyrinthian maze.</p>
<p>Billy, close beside her, as always, watched her
with a pensive sadness.</p>
<p>And so the Vigilantes went in and up along the
lower ways. There were those among them who
had been here before, who from time to time had
accompanied the snow-packer on his nightly trips
just for the curiosity of the thing. These several
men, among whom were Albright from the Pomo
settlement&ndash;&ndash;a squawman&ndash;&ndash;took the lead, and Albright,
keen as a hound on trail, picked up Old
Pete&#8217;s marks and signs at a running walk.</p>
<p>And so it was, that, while the sun was still
shining on the high peaks above and the ca&ntilde;ons
were filled with a strange pink light reflected from
the red and yellow faces of the rock, the Vigilantes
came suddenly to a halt, for Albright had
stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where it happened,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s
a blood-sign.&#8221; And he pointed to the Wall at a
spot about breast high. A thin dark line, no wider
than a blade of grass and about as long, spraying
out to nothing at the upper end, leaned along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
rock like a native marking. No other eye had
seen it. Not one in a thousand would have seen
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Kenset, &#8220;you&#8217;re the man for
more of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>They crowded around and examined the telltale
spray.</p>
<p>Not one among them but knew it for the stain
of blood.</p>
<p>From that they spread out and back to search
the sliding heaps of dust-like powdery rock-slide
that lay everywhere along the walls.</p>
<p>It took Albright five minutes by Kenset&#8217;s watch
to find the disturbed and clumsily smoothed dump
which held all that was mortal of the snow-packer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Last,&#8221; said Kenset as the men began to
dig with the spades brought along for the purpose,
&#8220;you had best step back a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tharon pushed nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my work,&#8221; she said with dignity. &#8220;I
started this, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a pitiful job that Service and those with
him had done for Old Pete. Rolled head-first
into a shallow hole&ndash;&ndash;no doubt with jest and laughter&ndash;&ndash;it
was his booted foot which first came to
view, sticking grotesquely up through the loose
slide-stuff.</p>
<p>It was brief work and grim work that followed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
and soon the weazened form, bent and
stiffened into something hardly human, lay in the
soft pink light on the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s floor.</p>
<p>Jim Banner knelt and examined it carefully and
minutely, then every man in the group did likewise.
They found evidence of one simple, staring fact&ndash;&ndash;Old
Pete had been shot squarely from behind, a
little to the left.</p>
<p>The bullet had undoubtedly pierced the heart&ndash;&ndash;a
great gaping hole in the left centre of the
breast in front attesting its course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Albright, coming back from a
short distance down, beneath the spray on the
wall, &#8220;here&#8217;s where something was taken up from
th&#8217; floor&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; blood he lost, I make no doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&ndash;&ndash;Miss Last,&#8221; said Kenset, &#8220;I
move we all move back and leave the ground to
Albright. There is fine work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>With one accord the mass moved back, clearing
a goodly space.</p>
<p>In the immediate vicinity there was little chance
of doing anything, for Service&#8217;s bunch, and themselves,
had trampled over the soft floor until all
original traces of the murder were blotted out.</p>
<p>Albright looked around and seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, alone?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Gimme Dick
Compos, there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; said Kenset.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>A tall, silent half-breed stepped forward and
without another word the two began to scan the
walls, the floors, the heaps of rotted rock, the
loose and tumbled boulders, not yet decomposed,
that lined the cut on both sides.</p>
<p>They stood in their tracks and looked, and the
concentration in their eyes was akin to that in the
eyes of a wild animal, hiding, hard-pressed, and
looking for a loophole for life.</p>
<p>The Vigilantes watched them in silence.</p>
<p>Presently Dick Compos stepped forward,
leaned down and searched the wall at the left.
Then he went forward, bent over, scanning each
inch. He looked above and below, the height of
a man&#8217;s shoulders, his hips, his knees.</p>
<p>Then he crept back, stopped at a particular
upstanding piece of stone, searched it closely&ndash;&ndash;stepped
in behind.</p>
<p>When he came out he looked over at Tharon
Last standing at the head of her people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one went along th&#8217; Wall here,&#8221; he
waved a slender brown hand at the ca&ntilde;on face.
&#8220;Three signs&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He indicated the heights he had scanned. They
stepped a bit nearer and looked. Several pairs
of Valley eyes saw what Dick Compos had seen, a
sign so fine that few would have called it that&ndash;&ndash;merely
a brushing, a smoothing of the fine-sandstone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
surface where a man&#8217;s shoulders, his hips, his
knees might have pressed had he stood waiting
there.</p>
<p>A bit nearer the standing pinnacle of rock, they
were evident again.</p>
<p>With one accord they turned and looked down
the ca&ntilde;on to where that thin line sprayed the face.
A close shot, such as would be necessary in the
darkness of the cut. Albright and Compos both
stepped to the rock and stood looking with those
narrowed, concentrated eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly Albright, looking back across his
shoulders, moved like a cat and picked up something
from ten feet away.</p>
<p>He held it on his palm&ndash;&ndash;an empty shell, such
as fitted a .44 Smith and Wesson.</p>
<p>He scanned it minutely, turned it over this way
and that, looked at it fore and aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firin&#8217; pin&#8217;s nicked,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; a leetle off
centre.&#8221;</p>
<p>For ten minutes the thing went from hand to
hand.</p>
<p>Then Kenset gave it to the coroner.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your clew, Mr. Banner,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Now we can begin. Let us be going back to
Corvan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it was that Old Pete, the snow-packer,
went back in state to the Golden Cloud, by relays
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
on men&#8217;s shoulders down the sounding passes,
through the dead cut, by pack-horse across the
levels, lashed stiffly to the saddle, a pitiful
burden.</p>
<p>Tharon Last, riding close after the calm fashion
of a strong man in the face of tragedy, thought
pensively of that night in spring when this little
old man had taken his life in his hands to save her
own.</p>
<p>It was a gift he had given her, nothing less, and
she made up her mind that Old Pete should sleep
in peace under the pointing pine at Last&#8217;s Holding&ndash;&ndash;and
that his cross should also stand beside
those other two in the carved granite.</p>
<p>Billy, watching, read her mind with the half-tragic
eyes of love.</p>
<p>Kenset, seemingly unconscious, but keenly alive
to everything, was at great loss to do so.</p>
<p>He hoped, with a surging tenseness, that this
fateful thing was sliding over into his hands to
work out, his and Banner&#8217;s. He knew full well
that he and Banner both were like to be slated for
an early death, but he did not care. In Corvan,
night had fallen when the cavalcade passed
through.</p>
<p>Bullard of the Golden Cloud had the grace
to come out and look at the little old man who
had worked for him so long and faithfully. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
that was all. They carried him home to Last&#8217;s
and buried him decently at dawn.</p>
<p>Then the Vigilantes again rode out. At their
head was Tharon; though both Kenset and Billy
tried to dissuade her.</p>
<p>At Corvan, Banner went through the town like
a wind, asking for the gun of every man he met.
By noon every .44 had been examined, one shell
exploded. Not one left the nicked, uneven sign
of the mysterious hammer which had snapped its
death into Old Pete&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>When the sun was straight overhead and all
Lost Valley was sweet with the summer haze, the
Vigilantes, close packed and silent, swung out
toward the Stronghold.</p>
<p>It was blue-dusk when they drew up at the
corrals beside the fortress house. Lounging
around in cat-like quiet were some thirty men,
riders, gun men, <i>vaqueros</i>.</p>
<p>When Banner called for Courtrey there was a
sound of boots on the board floors, inside, a
woman&#8217;s pleading voice, and the cattle king came
swinging out, his hands at his waist, his two guns
covering the crowd.</p>
<p>Tall, straight as a lance, his iron-grey head uncovered,
he was a striking figure of a man. His
henchmen watched him sharply. At his side clung
the slim woman, Ellen, her milky face thin and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
tragic. He shook her loose and faced the newcomers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtrey,&#8221; said Banner, &#8220;we&#8217;re here in th&#8217;
name o&#8217; th&#8217; law. We demand t&#8217; see them guns o&#8217;
yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the knowledge that Jim Banner was a brave
man needed confirmation, it had it in that speech.
Few men in the world could have made it, and
gotten away with it. None in a different setting.
Courtrey heard it, but he paid little heed to it at
the moment. His eyes went to the face of Tharon
Last and drank in its beauty hungrily.</p>
<p>Presently he shifted his gaze and regarded Kenset
with a cold light that was evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants &#8217;em?&#8221; he asked drawlingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell! Want <i>Courtrey&#8217;s</i> guns! You&#8217;re modest,
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what do you want, Tharon?&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the tenseness of the moment the
voice that had laughed at death and torture in
Round Valley became melting soft as it addressed
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law!&#8221; said Tharon, &#8220;Law&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; law I promised
you on Baston&#8217;s porch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? An&#8217; how do you think you&#8217;ll get that?
If I nod my head we&#8217;ll drive this bunch o&#8217; spawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
out o&#8217; here so quick it&#8217;ll make your head swim!
What do you think you&#8217;re doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>think</i>. I <i>know</i> now. Know what we
can do&ndash;&ndash;what th&#8217; law means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtrey glanced again at Kenset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got some imported knowledge, I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it or leave it! Show us them guns!&#8221;
cried Tharon harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;think&ndash;&ndash;so,&#8221; said Courtrey, nodding.</p>
<p>Like a pair of snakes gliding forward, Wylackie
Bob and the Arizona stranger were suddenly
in the foreground, hands hanging apparently
loose and careless, in reality tense as strung
wires, ready to snap with fire and lead.</p>
<p>The moment was pregnant. The very air
seemed charged with danger and death.</p>
<p>Then, with a strange cry, Tharon Last swung
sidewise from her saddle, for all the world as if
she were breaking under the strain, leaned far over
El Rey&#8217;s shoulder, and the next moment there
came a shot, snapping in the stillness.</p>
<p>With an oath and a lurch Courtrey flung backward,
tossed up his right arm, and fired with his
left. His ball went high in the air, wild. The
blood from that tossed right hand spurted over
Wylackie Bob beside him, the gun it had held
went hurtling away along the earth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>There was a movement, a surge, the flash of
guns and one of the settlers tumbled from his
saddle, poor Thomas of the doubting heart.
Courtrey&#8217;s men flashed together as one, thundered
backward to the wide doorstep, pressed together,
waited. The voice of Kenset rang like a
clarion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he swung off his horse to leap for that gun.</p>
<p>But another was before him.</p>
<p>With a scream of anguish that rang heaven-high,
Ellen shot forward and snatched it from the
spot where it had fallen.</p>
<p>Tall, white as a ghost in the rose-pink light that
was tinged with purple, she stood, swaying on her
feet, and faced them.</p>
<p>And she put the gun to her temple!</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; t&#8217; live for,&#8221; she said clearly
and pitifully, &#8220;but Courtrey&#8217;s life is worth what
I got to me. If you don&#8217;t clear out I&#8217;ll pull th&#8217;
trigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was tragic as death itself. The big blue
wells of her eyes were black with the spreading
pupils. Dark circles lay beneath them.</p>
<p>Her blue-veined hands were so thin the light
seemed to shine through them.</p>
<p>Her long white dress clung to her slim form.
From far back by the corral fence Cleve Whitmore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
watched her silently, his hands clenched
hard.</p>
<p>Tharon Last looked at her with wide eyes. She
had forgotten all about this woman in the passionate
hatred of Courtrey and the desire to pin
his crimes upon him. Now she wet her lips and
looked at Ellen long and silently. The pale lips
were quivering, the long arm shook as it held the
gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; whispered the girl, watching, &#8220;she
loves him! Like I loved Jim Last! Th&#8217; pain&#8217;s in
her heart, an&#8217; no mistake!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as if something strong within her folded
its iron arm upon itself, she began to back El
Rey. &#8220;Back out!&#8221; she called, &#8220;we ain&#8217;t no
woman-killers!&#8221;</p>
<p>With one accord, carefully, watching, the Vigilantes
began to back, counting the seconds,
expecting each moment to witness the most pitiful
thing Lost Valley with all its crimes, had ever
seen.</p>
<p>Some one lifted the body of Thomas and swung
it across a horse.</p>
<p>Back to the corner of the house, around, they
went, and finally, out in front they turned as one
man and rode away from the Stronghold&ndash;&ndash;and
Jim Banner was swearing like a fury, steadily, in
a high-pitched voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Failed!&#8221; he cried between his oaths, &#8220;failed
in our biggest job! That&#8217;s th&#8217; gun, all right, all
right, an&#8217; that damned woman beat us to it! Beat
us to it with her fool&#8217;s courage an&#8217; her sickenin&#8217;
love! Oh, t&#8217; hell with Courtrey an&#8217; all this Valley!
I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; move down th&#8217; Wall, s&#8217;help
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tharon Last forged to his side and gripped
his arm in her strong fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Jim Banner,&#8221; she said tensely.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve only begun. That&#8217;s th&#8217; gun, I make no
doubt, an&#8217; Ellen knew it&ndash;&ndash;but if we&#8217;re worth killin&#8217;
we&#8217;ll dig into this harder&#8217;n ever. Here&#8217;s poor
Thomas, makes one more notch on my record.
I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; quit! An&#8217; you&#8217;re th&#8217; bravest man
in Corvan, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>At Last&#8217;s Holding the Vigilantes stopped for
rest and food.</p>
<p>They had been in saddle the better part of
forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>Young Paula, Jos&eacute; and Anita set up a steaming
meal, and they ate like famished men, by relays
at the big table in the dining room.</p>
<p>Tharon Last sat quietly at the board&#8217;s head
throughout the meal, pensive, thinking of Ellen,
but grimly planning for the future.</p>
<p>And Billy and Kenset watched her, each with a
secret pain at his heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, Lord,&#8221; said Billy to himself, &#8220;she&#8217;s
listenin&#8217; when he speaks like she never listened
to any one before!&#8221;</p>
<p>In Kenset&#8217;s mind drilled over and over again
the ceaseless thought &#8220;A hand or a heart&ndash;&ndash;she
could hit them both with ease. It&#8217;s true, true,&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
a gun woman! Oh, Tharon, Tharon!&#8221; and
he did not know he spoke her name beneath his
breath.</p>
<p>But other things were crowding forward&ndash;&ndash;he
was leaning forward telling that circle of grim,
lean faces, that if they could not handle this thing
themselves, there were those in the big world of
below who could&ndash;&ndash;that there were men of the
Secret Service who could find that gun no matter
where Courtrey or Ellen hid it, that Lost
Valley, no matter what its isolation or its history,
was yet in the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., and could be
tamed.</p>
<p>Then the Vigilantes were gone with jangle of
spur and bit-chain, and he was the last to go, standing
by Captain in the dim starlight. Tharon stood
beside him, and for some unaccountable reason
the grim purpose of their acquaintance seemed to
drift away, to leave them together, alone under
the stars, a man and a maid. Kenset stood for
a long moment and looked at the faint outline of
her face. She was still in her riding clothes, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
head bare with its ribbon half untied in the nape
of her slender neck.</p>
<p>The tree-toads were singing off by the springhouse
and the cattle in the big corrals made the
low, ceaseless night-sounds common to a herd.</p>
<p>The riders were gone, the <i>vaqueros</i> were at
their posts around the resting stock, the low adobe
house was settling into the quiet of the night.</p>
<p>Miserably Kenset looked at this slip of a girl.</p>
<p>She was strange to him, unfathomable. There
were depths beneath the changing blue eyes which
appalled him. How would he feel toward her
when the thing was done&ndash;&ndash;when she had killed
Courtrey?</p>
<p>But she must not be allowed to do it. Not
though it took his life.</p>
<p>If she was pledged to this thing, he was no less
pledged to its prevention.</p>
<p>He felt a sadness within him as he saw the
soft curve of her cheek, the outline of her tawny
head.</p>
<p>With an impulse which he could not govern he
reached out suddenly and took her hands in his
and pressed them against his heart. The pounding
of that heart was noticeable through her hands
into his.</p>
<p>But he did not speak&ndash;&ndash;he could not.</p>
<p>But he had no need. He could have said nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
that would have cleared the situation, would
have told himself or her what was in that pounding
heart of his&ndash;&ndash;for to save his life he did not
know.</p>
<p>And Tharon frowned in the darkness and drew
her hands from under those pressing ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenset,&#8221; she said steadily, &#8220;you&#8217;re
always tryin&#8217; to make me weak, to break me down
with words an&#8217; looks an&#8217; touches. These hands
o&#8217; yours,&ndash;&ndash;<i>damn &#8217;em</i>, they <i>do</i> make me weak!
Don&#8217;t put &#8217;em on me again!&#8221;</p>
<p>And with a sudden, sharp savagery she struck
his hands off his breast, whirled away in the darkness
and was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SIGNAL FIRES IN THE VALLEY</h3>
</div>
<p>Kenset, two days later, gave Sam Drake
a check for five hundred dollars and a
letter, unpostmarked but sealed with tape
and wax. Drake, who owned some half-breed
Ironwoods, rode the best one down the Wall.</p>
<p>Kenset had cautioned him not to talk before he
left&ndash;&ndash;he feared Drake&#8217;s propensity for speech.
But he was the only man in Lost Valley whom he
felt he could approach.</p>
<p>With the courier&#8217;s departure he rode back to
the Holding and told Tharon and Conford what
he had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;These men are the best to be had,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and they will go anywhere on earth for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tharon frowned and struck a fist into a
soft palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you mean?&#8221; she cried, &#8220;by takin&#8217; my
work out of my hands like this? I won&#8217;t have it!
I won&#8217;t wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I meant when I caught your bridle that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
day in the glade,&#8221; answered the man, &#8220;to stop
you from bloodshed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went back to his cabin and his interrupted
work and set himself to wait in patience
for the return of Drake.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But in Lost Valley a leaven was rising. It had
begun insidiously to work with the appearance of
Kenset in Tharon&#8217;s band at Courtrey&#8217;s doorstep.
It burst up like a mushroom with a chance remark
made by Lola of the Golden Cloud&ndash;&ndash;Lola, who
had seen, since that night in spring when Tharon
Last stood in the door and promised to &#8220;get&#8221;
her father&#8217;s killer, that Courtrey was slipping
from her. A woman like Lola is hard to deceive.</p>
<p>Much experience had taught her to feel the
change of winds in the matter of allegiance.</p>
<p>She knew that surely and swiftly this man had
gone down the path of unreasoning love, that he
would give anything he possessed, do anything
possible, to win for himself this slim mistress of
Last&#8217;s Holding.</p>
<p>Therefore she played the one card she held,
hoping to rouse the bully, and did just the thing
she was trying to avert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck,&#8221; she said, her black head on his
shoulder, her dark eyes watching covertly his careless
face, &#8220;the Last girl is lost to every Valley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
man. Sooner or later she&#8217;ll leave the country,
mark my word, with this Forest Service fellow,
for she&#8217;s in love with him, though she doesn&#8217;t
know it yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a slow movement Courtrey loosed his
arm about Lola and lifted her from him. His
eyes were narrowed as he looked into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; he said, &#8220;what makes you
think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowledge,&#8221; said Lola, &#8220;long knowledge of
women and men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I thought that,&#8221; said Courtrey slowly, his
eyes losing sight of her as he seemed to look beyond
her. &#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;thought that&ndash;&ndash;why, hell! If
that&#8217;s th&#8217; truth&ndash;&ndash;why, it&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s th&#8217; lever!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he rose abruptly, though he had just settled
himself in Lola&#8217;s apartment for a pleasant
chat, as was his habit whenever he rode in from
the Stronghold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lola,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I might&#8217;s well
tell you that I&#8217;m plannin&#8217; to have this girl for mine,&ndash;&ndash;<i>mine</i>,
you understand, legally, by law. I can&#8217;t
have her like I&#8217;ve had you. She&#8217;d blow my head
off th&#8217; first time I stopped holdin&#8217; her hands.&#8221; He
laughed at the picture he had conjured, then went
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so I feel grateful to you, old girl, for that
remark. It sets me thinkin&#8217;.&#8221; And he stooped and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
kissed her on the lips. The woman returned the
kiss, a wonderful caress, slow, soft, alluring, but
the man did not notice.</p>
<p>His face was flushed, his eyes studying.</p>
<p>Then he swung quickly out through the Golden,
Cloud, and Lola slipped limply down on a couch
and covered her ashen cheeks with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Buck!&#8221; she whispered brokenly, &#8220;Oh,
Buck! Buck!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Courtrey went straight home, still, cold, thinking
hard. His henchmen left him in solitude after
the first word or two. They knew him well, and
that something was brewing.</p>
<p>At midnight that night he roused Wylackie
Bob, Black Bart and the man who was known as
Arizona, and the four of them went out on the
levels for a secret talk.</p>
<p>The next day the master of the Stronghold rode
away on Bolt. As he left, Ellen, standing in the
doorway like a pale ghost, lifted her tragic eyes
to his face with the look of a faithful dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;, Buck?&#8221; she asked timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off,&#8221; said the man shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;goin&#8217; to kiss me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed cruelly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not after what I ben a-hearin&#8217;, I ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang forward, catching at his knee.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what you ben a-hearin&#8217;? There ain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; about me you could a-heard, Buck, dear!
Nothin&#8217; in this world! I ben true to you as your
shadow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Every soul within hearing knew the words for
the utter and absolute truth, yet Courtrey looked
at Wylackie Bob, at Arizona, and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like hell, you have!&#8221; he said, struck the
Ironwood and was gone around the corner of the
house with the sound of thunder.</p>
<p>Ellen wet her lips and looked around like a
wounded animal.</p>
<p>Her brother Cleve, saddling up a little way
apart, cast a long studying glance at Wylackie
and Arizona. He jerked the cinch so savagely
that the horse leaped and struck.</p>
<p>For four days there was absolute dearth at
the Stronghold.</p>
<p>Courtrey did not return. Ellen timidly tried to
find out from the <i>vaqueros</i> where he had gone,
but they evaded her.</p>
<p>Then, on the morning of that day, Steptoe Service,
grinning and important, came to the Stronghold
and served on Ellen a summons in suit for
divorce.</p>
<p>She met him at the door and invited him in,
timidly and shyly, but he stood on the stone and
made known his business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>At first she did not understand, was like a child
told something too deep for its intellect to grasp,
bewildered.</p>
<p>Then, when Service made it brutally plain, she
slipped down along the doorpost like a wilted lily
and lay long and white on the sand-scrubbed floor.
Her women, loving her desperately, gathered her
up and shut the door in the sheriff&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>They sent for Cleve, and not even the presence
of Black Bart in the near corral could keep the
brother from running into the darkened room
where Ellen lay, too stunned to rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn him!&#8221; he gritted, falling on his knees
beside her, &#8220;this&#8217;s what&#8217;s come of it! I ben
lookin&#8217; for something of its like. Let him go.
We&#8217;ll leave Lost Valley, Ellen. We&#8217;ll go out an&#8217;
start another life, begin all over again. We&#8217;re
both too young to be floored by a man like Courtrey.
Let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the woman turned her waxen face to the
wall and shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no life in this world for me without
Buck,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;If he don&#8217;t want
me, I don&#8217;t want myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dont&#8217; want to hang to him, do you, Sis?&#8221;
begged the man, &#8220;don&#8217;t want to stay at th&#8217;
Stronghold after this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rather stay here under Buck&#8217;s feet like th&#8217;
poorest of his dogs than be well-off somewheres
where I couldn&#8217;t never see him again, never look
in his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; groaned Cleve, &#8220;you love him like
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ellen, wearily, &#8220;like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then by th&#8217; Eternal!&#8221; swore Cleve softly,
&#8220;here you&#8217;ll stay if it takes all th&#8217; law in th&#8217; United
States to keep you here. I&#8217;ll file your answer tomorrow&ndash;&ndash;protest
to th&#8217; last word!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he rode into Corvan, only to find that
Courtrey and Courtrey&#8217;s influence had been there
before him, that a cold sense of disaster seemed
to permeate the town and all those whom he met
therein.</p>
<p>He found the &#8220;Court House crowd&#8221; tight-lipped
and careful.</p>
<p>And Ben Garland set the day for trial at a
ridiculously early date, for all the world as if the
thing had been cut and dried at some secret
conclave.</p>
<p>Courtrey was playing his game with a daring
hand, true to his name and habit.</p>
<p>Dusk was falling in Lost Valley. The long
blue shadows had swept out from the Rockface,
covering first the homesteads under the Wall, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the great grazing stretches, then Corvan, then the
open levels again, then the mouth of Black Coulee
and lastly sweeping eastward to hush the life at
Last&#8217;s Holding in that soft, sweet quiet which
comes with the day&#8217;s work done.</p>
<p>Out at the corrals Billy and Conford, Jack and
Bent and Curly, put the finishing touches to the
routine of precaution which the Holding never
relaxed, day or night.</p>
<p>Inside the dusky living room where the bright
blankets glowed on the walls and the <i>ollas</i> hung
in the deep window places, Tharon Last sat at
the little old melodeon and played her nameless
tunes. She did not look at the yellowed keys. Instead
her blue eyes, deep and glowing, wandered
down along the southern slopes and she was lost
in unconscious dreams. Once again she saw the
trim figure of the forest man as she had seen him
come stiffly into her range of vision that day in
Corvan. She recalled his quiet eyes, dark and
speaking, the odd way his hair went straight back
from his forehead. She wondered why she should
think of him at all.</p>
<p>He was against her&ndash;&ndash;was a force that played
directly against all her plans of life, her precepts.
Moreover, she had told him she feared
he was soft&ndash;&ndash;like a woman&ndash;&ndash;some women&ndash;&ndash;that
there was in him a lack of the straight man-courage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
which was the only standard in Lost
Valley.</p>
<p>And yet&ndash;&ndash;she waited on his word, somehow&ndash;&ndash;held
her hand from her sworn duty for a while,
waiting&ndash;&ndash;for what?</p>
<p>Ah, she knew! Deep in the soul of her she
knew, vaguely and dimly to be sure, but she
knew that it was for the time when the die should
be cast&ndash;&ndash;that he might prove himself for what he
was.</p>
<p>For some vague reason she knew she would not
kill Courtrey until this man stood by.</p>
<p>She wondered what Courtrey meant by this
strange quiet following the tragic moment at the
Stronghold steps when the Vigilantes had challenged
him and ridden away.</p>
<p>And then, all suddenly, into her dreaming there
came the sound of a horse&#8217;s hoofs on the sounding-board
without&ndash;&ndash;slow hoofs, uncertain. For one
swift second that sound, coming out of the dusk
with its uncertainty, sent a chill of memory down
her nerves. So had come El Rey that night in
spring when he brought Jim Last home to die!</p>
<p>She rose swiftly and silently and stepped to the
western door.</p>
<p>There, in the shadows and the softness of coming
night, a horse loomed along the green stretch,
came plodding up to stop and stand before her, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
brown horse, with the stirrups of his saddle hung
on the pommel, his rein tied short up&ndash;&ndash;Captain,
the good, common friend of Kenset&ndash;&ndash;of the&ndash;&ndash;foothills!</p>
<p>Tharon felt the blood pour back upon her heart
and stay there for an awful moment. She put up
a hand and touched her throat, and to save her
life she did not know why this sudden sickening
fear should come upon her.</p>
<p>She had seen men killed, had known tragedy
and loss and heartache, but never before had she
seen the crest of the distant Wall to dance upon
the pale skyline so. Then she whirled into the
house and her young voice pealed out a call&ndash;&ndash;Billy,
Conford, Bent&ndash;&ndash;she drew them to her running
through the deep house&ndash;&ndash;to point to the silent
messenger and question them with wide blue eyes
where fear rose up like a living thing.</p>
<p>Billy at her shoulder, looked not at Captain,
but at her.</p>
<p>A sigh lifted his breast, but he stifled it at birth
and turned with the others back toward the corrals.
Tharon, running toward the deep room
where the Virgin stood in Her everlasting beauty,
unfastened her soft white dress as she ran. Inside
she flung herself on her knees before the
Holy Mother and poured out a trembling
prayer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not that! Oh, Mary, not that! Let it not
be <i>that</i>!&#8221; she whispered thickly. Then she was
up, into her riding clothes&ndash;&ndash;was out where the boys
were hurriedly saddling the Finger Marks. Presently
she was on El Rey and shooting like a silver
shaft in the summer dusk down along the green
levels toward the east. They rode in silence, Conford,
Bent, Jack, Curly, Billy and herself, and a
thousand thoughts were boiling miserably in two
hearts.</p>
<p>El Rey, Golden, Redbuck, Drumfire, Westwind
and Sweetheart, they went down along the sounding
dark plain, a magnificent band. The whole
earth seemed to resound to the thunder of their
going, and for once in their lives her beauties
could not run fast enough for the mistress of
Last&#8217;s.</p>
<p>They went like the wind itself, and yet they
were slow to Tharon.</p>
<p>Out of the open levels there swung up to meet
them and to fade into the night, the standing
willows by the Silver Hollow. The sloping
stretches began to lift, dotted by the oaks and
digger-pines for whose sake Kenset had come to
Lost Valley. They shot through them, up along
the sharply lifting skirts of the hills, in between
the guarding pines that formed the gateway to
the little glade where the singing stream went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
down and the cabin stood at the head. Tharon&#8217;s
throat was tight, as if a hand pressed hard upon
it. The high tops of the pines seemed to cut the
sky grotesquely. There was no light at the dim
log house, no sound in the silent glade. Off to
the right they heard the low of the little red cow
which served the forest man with milk.</p>
<p>They pounded to a sliding stop in the cabin&#8217;s
yard and Conford called sharply into the silent
darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenset! Hello&ndash;&ndash;Kenset!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon held her breath and listened. There
was no sound except a night bird calling from the
highest pine-tip.</p>
<p>Carefully the men dismounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay up, Tharon, dear,&#8221; the foreman
said quietly, &#8220;until we look around.&#8221;</p>
<p>But to save her life the girl could not. What
was this trembling that seized her limbs? Why
did the stars, come out on the purple sky, shift
so strangely to her eyes? She slipped off El Rey
and stood by his shoulder waiting. Conford struck
a flare and lit a candle, holding it carefully before
him, shielding it with his palm behind it to throw
the gleam away from his face, into the cabin.
The pale light illumined the whole interior, and
it was empty. The keen eyes of the riders went
over every inch of space before they entered&ndash;&ndash;along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the walls, in the bed, under the tables. Then
they filed in and Tharon followed, gazing around
with eyes that ached behind their lids. There on
the northern wall between the windows, was the
great spread of the beautiful picture she had
helped the forest man to hang. There were his
books on the table&#8217;s edge. She looked twice&ndash;&ndash;the
last one on the pile at a certain corner was just
as she had placed it there, a trifle crooked with
the edge, but neatly in line with those beneath it.
There was the big chair in which she had waited
while he made the little meal&ndash;&ndash;there was his desk
in the ingle nook, his maps upon it. It was
all so familiar, so filled with his personality, that
Tharon felt the very power of his dark eyes,
smiling, grave&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Jack Masters suddenly. &#8220;Burt,
what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Conford stepped quickly around the table and
held his candle down.</p>
<p>Tharon pushed forward and looked over the
leaning shoulders.</p>
<p>There on the brown and green grass rug a rich
dark stain was drying&ndash;&ndash;blood, some three days
old.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, did the universe sag and darken
to the Mistress of Last&#8217;s.</p>
<p>She put out a hand to steady herself and found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
it grasped in the strong one of Billy, who stood
at her shoulder like her shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Steady, Tharon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew her trembling fingers across her eyes,
wet her lips which felt dry as ashes. The same
ache that had come with Jim Last&#8217;s final smile
was already in her heart, but intensified a thousand
times. She felt all suddenly, as if there was nothing
in Lost Valley worth while, nothing in all the
world! That drying stain at her feet seemed to
shut out the sun, moon and stars with its sinister
darkness. She felt a nausea at the pit of her
stomach, a need for air in her cramped lungs.</p>
<p>Strange, she had never known that one could be
so detached from all familiar things, could seem
so lost in a sea of stupid agony. Why was it so?
If this dark blot of blood had come from the veins
of Billy now, of Conford, or Jack or Curly, her
own men, would she have lost her grip like this?
And then she became dully conscious that Billy
had put her in the big chair by the table and had
joined the others in their exhaustive search for any
clew to the tragedy. She saw the moon rising
over the tops of the pine trees at the glade&#8217;s edge,
heard the little song of the running stream.</p>
<p>That was the little stream that Kenset had
looked for in his ideal spot, this was the home he
had made for himself, these were the things of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
other life he had known, these soft, dark pictures,
the books on the tables, the brass things shining
in the light from the lamp.... She knew that
she was cold in the summer night, that she was
staring miserably out of the open door, scarcely
conscious of the scattered voices of her men,
searching, searching, hunting, in widening circles
outside.... Then they came back talking in low
voices and she roused herself desperately. Her
limbs were stiff when she rose from the big chair,
her hands were icy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use, Tharon,&#8221; said Conford quietly, &#8220;we
can&#8217;t find a damned thing. If Courtrey&#8217;s bunch
killed Kenset they made a clean get-away with all
evidence. That much has th&#8217; new law done in th&#8217;
Valley&ndash;&ndash;killed th&#8217; insolence of th&#8217; gun man. Let&#8217;s
go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Billy, faithful and still, who helped her&ndash;&ndash;for
the first time in her life!&ndash;&ndash;to mount a horse.
She went up on El Rey as if she were old. Then
they were riding down the smooth floor of the
little glade, leaving that darkened cabin at its
head to stand in tragic loneliness.</p>
<p>She saw the tops of the guarding pines at the
gateway, rode out between them. The moon was
up in majesty, and by its light Jack Masters suddenly
leaned down to look at something, pulled up,
swept down from his saddle, cowboy fashion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
hanging by a foot and a hand, and picked up something
which he examined keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said quickly, &#8220;th&#8217; beet-man&#8217;s
badge!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out on his palm a small dark object,
the copper-coloured shield which had shone on
Kenset&#8217;s breast!</p>
<p>Its double-tongued fastener was twisted far
awry, as if it had been wrenched away by violence.</p>
<p>Conford turned and looked back to the cabin,
as if he measured the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been funny work here as sure&#8217;s hell,&#8221;
he said profoundly.</p>
<p>Then they rode on, all silent, thinking. It was
near dawn when they rode up along the sounding-board
and put in at Last&#8217;s. Billy reached up
tender arms and took Tharon off El Rey, and
for the first time she gave herself wearily into
them as if she were done.</p>
<p>As she opened the door into her own dusky
room the pale Virgin, touched by a silver shaft
of the sinking moon, stood out in startling, ethereal
beauty, Her meek hands folded on Her breast.
Tharon Last stumbled forward and sank in a heap
at Her feet, her arms about the statue&#8217;s knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hail&ndash;&ndash;Mary&ndash;&ndash;intercede for&ndash;&ndash;him&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she
faltered, and then the shining Virgin, the dim
mystery of the shadowy room, faded out to leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
her for the first time in her strong life, a bit of
senseless clay.</p>
<p>When she again opened her eyes the little winds
of day were fanning her cheeks and old Anita
was tugging at her shoulders, voluble with fright.</p>
<p>To the riders of Last&#8217;s the tragedy was nothing
more than any other that they had known in Lost
Valley. They went about their work as usual.</p>
<p>Only Billy was filled with a sickening anguish at
the knowledge that he was not able to offer one
smallest saving straw to the girl in the big house&ndash;&ndash;for
Billy knew.</p>
<p>All day Tharon sat like a rock in her own room,
staring with unseeing eyes at the blank whitewashed
walls. She did not yet know what ailed
her, why this killing, more than that of poor
Harkness, should make her sick to her soul&#8217;s
foundations. Yet it was so. Even the thought of
her sworn duty was vague before her for a time.
Then it seemed to come forward out of the mass
of fleeting memories&ndash;&ndash;Kenset that day at Baston&#8217;s
steps shapely, trim, halted&ndash;&ndash;Kenset laughing
over the little meal beside the table where the
books lay&ndash;&ndash;Kenset grasping her shoulder when
she whirled to mount El Rey and challenge the
Stronghold single-handed&ndash;&ndash;to come forward like
a calming, steadying thing and turn the pain to
purpose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>There was no one now to hold her back, no
vital hands to press hers upon a beating heart, to
make her untrue to her given word!</p>
<p>Now she could go out, reckless and grim in her
utter disregard of the outcome, and kill Courtrey
where he stood. The time had come. There
should be another cross in the granite beneath the
pointing pine.</p>
<p>As if the whirling universe settled back to its
ordered place the right proportion came back
to her vision, the breath seemed to lighten her
holden lungs.</p>
<p>Once again the girl arose and steadied herself,
smoothed her tawny hair, looked at her hands to
find them free from the shaking that had weakened
them.</p>
<p>She dressed herself and went out among her
people, quiet and pale.</p>
<p>The twilight had fallen and all the western
part of the Valley was blue with shadow. Only
on Kenset&#8217;s foothills was the rosy light glowing,
a tragic, aching light, it seemed to her. She saw
all the little world of Lost Valley with new eyes,
sombre eyes, in which there was no sense of its
beauty. She wondered anxiously how soon she
could meet Courtrey, and where. And then with
the suddenness of an ordered play, the question
was answered for her, for out of the dusk and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
the purple shadows a Pomo rider came on a running
pony and halted out a stone&#8217;s throw, calling
for the &#8220;Se&ntilde;orita,&#8221; his hands held up in token of
friendliness.</p>
<p>Without a thought of treachery Tharon went
out to him and took the letter he handed her&ndash;&ndash;swinging
around for flight as the paper left his
hand, for the riders of Last&#8217;s were known all up
and down the land. This dusky messenger took
no chances he could avoid. He was well down
along the slope by the time the boys came clanking
around the house.</p>
<p>And Tharon, standing in the twilight like a slim
white ghost, was staring over their heads, her
lips ashen, the scrawled letter trembling in her
hands. For this is what she read, straining her
young eyes in the fading light.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;Tharon. You must know by now that I mean
bisness. All this Vigilant bisness ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217;

<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; text-align:right'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Courtrey.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>For a long moment the Mistress of Last&#8217;s stood
in profound quiet, as if she could not move. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
was held in a trance like those dreadful night-dreams
when one is locked in deadly inertia, helpless.
The net which had been weaving in Courtrey&#8217;s
fertile brain was finished, flung, and closing
in upon her before she knew of its existence. An
awe of his cleverness, his trickery, gripped her in
a clutch of ice. The whole fabric of her own
desires and plans and purposes seemed to crumple
like the white ash in a dead fire, leaving her nothing.
She had been out-witted instead of outfought.
One more evidence of the man&#8217;s baseness,
his unscrupulous cunning.</p>
<p>He played his trump card and it was a winner,
sweeping the table&ndash;&ndash;for she knew before she
finished that difficult reading that she would do
anything in all the world to stop that &#8220;true
bullet&#8221; in the heart that had pounded beneath her
open palms.... Knew she would break her
given word to Jim Last&ndash;&ndash;knew she would forsake
the Holding&ndash;&ndash;that she would crawl to Courtrey&#8217;s
feet and kiss his hand, if only he would spare
Kenset of the foothills, would send him out to
that vague world of below, never to return!</p>
<p>She swayed drunkenly on her feet for a time
that seemed ages long. Then life came back in
her with a rush. She broke the nightmare dream
and gasped out a broken command to her faithful
ones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Billy!&#8221; she said thickly, &#8220;Oh, Billy! If you
love me, run! Run an&#8217; build a fire&ndash;&ndash;one fire!&ndash;&ndash;only
<i>one</i> fire, Billy, dear&ndash;&ndash;out by th&#8217; cottonwoods
to th&#8217; left&ndash;&ndash;of th&#8217; Holdin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went and sat limply down on the step
at the western door, leaned her head against the
deep adobe wall, and fell to weeping as if the very
heart in her would wash itself away in tears.</p>
<p>And Billy, numb with anguish but true to the
love he bore her, went swiftly out and set that
beacon glowing. Its red light flaring against the
blue darkness of the falling night seemed like a
bodeful omen of sorrow and disaster, of death
and failure and despair.</p>
<p>Tharon on the sill roused herself to watch it
leap and glow, then turned her deep eyes to where
she knew the Stronghold lay.</p>
<p>Presently out upon the distant black curtain of
the night there flared that other fire, signal of life
to Kenset somewhere in the Ca&ntilde;on Country&ndash;&ndash;and
then her lips drew into a thin hard line and she
straightened her young form stiffly up, put a hand
hard upon her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little time, Courtrey!&#8221; she whispered to
herself, &#8220;Jus&#8217; a little time an&#8217; luck, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll give
you th&#8217; double-cross or die, damn your soul to
hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy, coming softly in along the adobe wall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
caught the whisper, felt rather than heard its
meaning, and turned back with the step of a cat.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>An hour later, when all the Holding was quiet
for the night, drifting to early rest after the day&#8217;s
hard work, the Mistress of Last&#8217;s, booted, dressed
in riding clothes, her fair head covered by a sombrero,
her daddy&#8217;s guns at her hips, crept softly to
the gate of El Rey&#8217;s own corral. She went like a
thief, crouching, watching, without a sound, and
saddled the big stallion in careful softness. She
led him gently out and around toward the cottonwoods,
away from the house. When she was well
away she put foot to stirrup and went up as the
king leaped for his accustomed flight.</p>
<p>But Tharon pulled him down. She wanted no
thunder on the sounding-board tonight. But soft
as she had been, as careful, there was one at the
Holding who followed her every act, who went
for a horse, too, who saddled Drumfire in silence
and who crept down the sounding-board&ndash;&ndash;Billy
the faithful. Far down along the plain toward the
Black Coulee he let the red roan out, so that the
girl, keen of hearing as of sight, caught the following
beat of hoofs, stopped, listened, understood
and reined El Rey up to wait.</p>
<p>And soon out of the shadows cast by the eastern
ramparts, where the moon was rising, she saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the rider coming. A quick mist of tears suffused
her eyes, a sick feeling gripped her heart.</p>
<p>Here was another mixed in the sorry tangle!
She had always known vaguely that Billy was
one with her, that his heart was the deep heart
of her friend.</p>
<p>He was the one she always wanted near her
in times of stress, it was with him she liked to
ride in the Big Shadow when the sun went down
behind the Ca&ntilde;on Country.</p>
<p>But now she did not want him. She had a
keen desire to see him safely out of this&ndash;&ndash;this
which was to be the end, one way or the other,
of the blood-feud between the Stronghold and
Last&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Now as he loped up and stopped abreast of her
in silence, she reached out a hand and caught his
in a close clasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you, Billy, dear,&#8221; she said miserably,
&#8220;not because I don&#8217;t love you, but because I
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to see you shot by Courtrey&#8217;s gang.
This is one time, boy, when I want you to leave
me alone, to go back without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rider shook his head against the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t do it, little girl,&#8221; he said wistfully,
&#8220;you know I couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I your mistress, Billy?&#8221; asked Tharon
sternly. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I your boss?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure are,&#8221; said the boy with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I always been a good boss to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best in th&#8217; world. Good as Jim Last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Tharon sharply, &#8220;it&#8217;s up to you
to take my orders. I order you now&ndash;&ndash;go
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowboy leaned down suddenly and kissed
the hand he held.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at your shoulder, Tharon, dear,&#8221; he said
with simple dignity, &#8220;like your shadow. At your
foot like the dogs that never forsake th&#8217; herds. I
couldn&#8217;t go back an&#8217; leave you&ndash;&ndash;not though I died
for it tonight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say no more about it. I don&#8217;t know
where you&#8217;re goin&#8217;, but wherever it is, there I&#8217;m
goin&#8217;, too, an&#8217; on my way. You can tell me or
not, just as you please, but let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time Tharon Last sat in the starlight
and watched the crests of the distant mountains
fringed with the silver of the moon that was rising
behind them, and her throat ached with tears.
All these things that hurt her, these unknown,
tangled things that she knew dimly meant Life,
had come to her with the advent of Kenset in
Lost Valley. She wished passionately for a fleeting
moment that he had never come, that the old
swinging, rushing life of the ranges had never
known his holding influence. Then she felt again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
the hammering of his heart beneath her palms, and
nothing mattered in all the world beside.</p>
<p>It was a thing beyond her ken, something
ordered by fate. She must go on, blindly as running
waters, regardless of all that drowned.</p>
<p>But she loosed her hand from Billy&#8217;s, leaned to
his shoulder, put her arm about his neck and drew
his face to hers. Softly, tenderly, she kissed him
upon the lips, and she did not know that that was
the cruelest thing she had ever done in all her
kindly life, did not see the deathly pallor that overspread
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to th&#8217; Ca&ntilde;on Country, Billy,&#8221; she
said simply, &#8220;to find th&#8217; Cup o&#8217; God an&#8217; Kenset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she straightened in her saddle and gave
El Rey the rein.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was two of the clock by the starry heavens
when these two riders entered the blind opening in the
Rockface and disappeared. El Rey, the
mighty, tossed his great head and whistled,
stamped his hoofs in the dead sift of the silencing
floor. He had never before lost sight of the sky,
never felt other breath in his nostrils than the
keen plain&#8217;s wind.</p>
<p>Now he shook himself and halted, went on
again, and again halted, to be urged forward by
Tharon&#8217;s spurred heels in his flanks. Up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
through the eerie pass they went without speech,
for each heart was filled to overflowing with
thoughts and fears.</p>
<p>To Billy there was something fateful, bodeful
in the dead darkness, the stillness. It seemed
to him as if he left forever behind him the open
life of the ranges, the gay and careless days of
riding after Tharon&#8217;s cattle.</p>
<p>For five years he had lived at Last&#8217;s, under
master and mistress, content, happy. The half-remembered
world of below had never called him.
The light on the table under the swinging lamp
with Tharon&#8217;s face therein, the murmur of the
stream through her garden, the whisper of the
cottonwoods, these had been sufficient. He had,
subconsciously, thanked his Maker for these
things, had served them with a whole heart. They
had been his all, his life. Now the cottonwoods
seemed far away, remote, the life of the deep
ranch house a thing of long ago. All these things
had given way to something that sapped the sunlight
from the air, the very blueness from the
vaulted skies, something that had come with the
quiet man of the pine-tree badge. So Billy sighed
in the darkness and sat easily on Drumfire,
his slim left hand fidgeting with the swinging
rein.</p>
<p>And Tharon was lost, too, in a maze of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
thoughts. She sat straight as a lance, tense, alive,
keen, staring into the narrow bore of the high
ceiled cut, thinking feverishly. Was Kenset
really alive? Had Courtrey been square with her?
Or was he even now lying stiff and stark somewhere
in the high cuts, his dark eyes dull with
death, that beating heart forever stilled? She
caught her breath with a whistling sigh, felt her
head swim at the picture. If he was&ndash;&ndash;<i>if</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>he</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>was</i>&ndash;&ndash;!
She fingered the big guns at her hip and
savagery took hold of her. Courtrey&#8217;s left wrist
to match his right. Then some pretty work about
him to make him wait&ndash;&ndash;then a shot through his
stomach&ndash;&ndash;he would spit blood and reel, but he
wouldn&#8217;t die&ndash;&ndash;the butcher!&ndash;&ndash;for a little while,
and she would taunt him with Harkness&ndash;&ndash;and Jim.
Last shot in the back&ndash;&ndash;with Old Pete&ndash;&ndash;and with&ndash;&ndash;with
Kenset&ndash;&ndash;the one man&ndash;&ndash;Oh, the one man in
all the world whose quiet smile was unforgettable,
whose vital hands were upon hers now, like ghost-hands,
would always be upon hers if she lived to
be old like Anita or died at dawn today! And
Kenset had counseled her to peace! To keep
the stain of blood from her own hands! She
laughed aloud, suddenly, a ghastly sound that
made cold chills go down her rider&#8217;s spine, for
it was the mad laughter of the blood-lust! Billy
knew that Jim Last in his best moments was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
never so coldly a killer as his daughter was tonight.</p>
<p>So they traversed the roofed cut and came out
into the starlight of the first ca&ntilde;on. Up this they
went in single file. They passed the place where
Albright had found the dark spray on the ca&ntilde;on
wall, the standing rock where the gun with the
untrue firing pin had kicked away its shell. A
little farther on was the disturbed and trampled
heap of slide which had held Old Pete&#8217;s body. In
silence they rode on, the horses&#8217; hoofs striking a
million echoes from the reverberating crosscuts.</p>
<p>The moon was shining above, but here there
was only a sifted light, a ghostly radiance of
starlight and painted walls. Tharon, riding ahead,
went unerringly forward as if she traveled the
open ways of the Valley floor. She turned from
the main ca&ntilde;on toward the left and passed the
mouth of Old Pete&#8217;s snow-bed. Between this and
that standing spire and pinnacle she went, with a
strong certainty that presently stirred Billy to
speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tharon, dear,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;hadn&#8217;t we
better leave a mark or two along this-a-way?
Ain&#8217;t you got no landmarks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can if you want,&#8221; the girl said briefly, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t need landmarks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then how you know the way? There ain&#8217;t
no one knows th&#8217; Ca&ntilde;on Country&ndash;&ndash;but Courtrey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know it,&#8221; she said simply but with
profound conviction. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>feelin&#8217;</i> it, Billy. I
know I&#8217;m goin&#8217; straight to th&#8217; Cup o&#8217; God. I&#8217;m
blind as a bat, it seems, yet goin&#8217; straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted a hand and crossed herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; straight&ndash;&ndash;Mary willin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll come
back straight. It lies up there an&#8217; to th&#8217; left
again.&#8221; She made a wide gesture that swept up
and out, embracing the towering walls, the half-seen
peaks against the stars.</p>
<p>Billy shut his lips and said no more.</p>
<p>Up there lay False Ridge, the sinister, dropping
spine that came down from the uplands outside
where the real great world began, and lured
those who traveled down it to crumbling precipice
and yawning pit, to sliding slope and slant that,
once ridden down, could never be scaled again,
according to the weird stories that were told of
it.</p>
<p>But if Tharon went to the Ca&ntilde;ons, there lay
his trail, too. If she went down False Ridge to
death in the pits and waterless cuts, he asked no
better lot than to follow&ndash;&ndash;the faithful dog at her
foot, the shadow at her shoulder.</p>
<p>And so it was that dawn crept up the blue-velvet
of the night sky and sent its steel-blue light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
deep in the painted splits, and they rode unerringly
forward up the sounding passes.</p>
<p>When the light increased enough to show the
way they came abruptly to the spot where it was
necessary to leave the horses. The floor of the
ca&ntilde;on up which they were traveling lifted sharply
in one huge step, breast-high to a man.</p>
<p>Tharon in the lead halted and looked for a
moment all up and down the wondrous maze of
pale, tall openings that encompassed them all
round.</p>
<p>She turned in her saddle and looked back the
way they had come. There was darker shadow,
going downward, but here and there those pale
mouths gaped, long ribbons of space dropping
from the heights above down to their level.</p>
<p>Up any one a man might turn and lose himself
completely, for they in turn were cut and ribboned
with other mouths, leaving spires and walls and
faces a thousand-fold on every hand.</p>
<p>Tharon, even in the tensity and preoccupation
of the hour, drew in her breath and the pupils of
her blue eyes spread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; Ca&ntilde;on Country!&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;I
always knew it would be like this&ndash;&ndash;too great to tell
about! I knew it would hold somethin&#8217; for me&ndash;&ndash;always
knew it&ndash;&ndash;either life an&#8217; its best&ndash;&ndash;or death.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>There was a simple grandeur about the earnest
words, and Billy, his face grey in the steely light,
felt the heart in his breast thrill with their portent.</p>
<p>No matter what the Ca&ntilde;ons held for her&ndash;&ndash;either
that glorious fulfillment of life, or the
simple austerity of death&ndash;&ndash;he would have a part
in it, would have served her to the last, true to the
love he bore her, true to himself.</p>
<p>And nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing under God&#8217;s heaven,
save death itself&ndash;&ndash;could ever wipe out the memory
of that kiss, given from the depths of her loving
heart, the sign-manuel of her undying affection
and friendship, the one and only touch of her inviolate
red lips that he had ever known the
Mistress of Last&#8217;s to give to any man, save Jim
Last himself.</p>
<p>He wiped a hand across his forehead, damp
with more than the night cold, and dismounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave th&#8217; horses here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
an extra rope to string across an&#8217; make a small
corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not add that he would fasten this slim
barrier lightly, so that a horse that really wanted
to break out&ndash;&ndash;in the frantic madness of thirst,
say,&ndash;&ndash;might do so.</p>
<p>Then he set about his task&ndash;&ndash;but Tharon stood
with strained eyes looking up&ndash;&ndash;and up&ndash;&ndash;and ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
up to the dimly appearing, looming spine of False
Ridge.</p>
<p>Over there, she knew in her heart, lay the
hidden Cup o&#8217; God, with its secret, the secret
that meant all the world to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE UNTRUE FIRING PIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Tharon turned back and looked long at El
Rey. She wondered if she would ever see
the great silver-blue stallion again, ever
feel the wind singing by her cheeks, ever hear the
thunder of his running on the hollow ranges. She
saw the stain of Jim Last&#8217;s blood on the big
studded saddle and a pain like death stabbed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him,&#8221; she had promised on that tragic
day, &#8220;so help me God!&#8221; and had made the sign
of the Cross.</p>
<p>What did she now?</p>
<p>Cast away all certainty of that fulfilment because
a man&ndash;&ndash;a man almost a stranger&ndash;&ndash;lay somewhere
in the Ca&ntilde;on Country, crawled somewhere
along False Ridge, perhaps, wounded and sick
with fever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hurry!&#8221; she whispered as Billy made
secure his last light knot in the rope gateway
across the cut and came to join her.</p>
<p>She scrambled up the bench in the ca&ntilde;on floor,
gained her feet and went forward at a rush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, Tharon,&#8221; warned the rider, &#8220;you
ain&#8217;t used to climbin&#8217;. Save your wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true advice. Long before the sun was
high overhead and day was broad in the painted
cracks she had begun to heed it. As she swung
up the ever lifting floors, threaded this way and
that between the thin intercepting walls that towered
hundreds of feet straight up, she cast her
wide eyes up in wonder. Always she had watched
the Ca&ntilde;on Country from her western door, always
it had held her with a binding lure.</p>
<p>There was that about its mystery, its austere
majesty, that had thrilled her heart from babyhood.
She had pictured it a thousand times and
always it had looked just so&ndash;&ndash;pink and grey and
saffron, pale and misty with light when the sun
was high, blue and wonderful and black as the
luminary lowered, leaving the quick shadows.</p>
<p>Hour after hour they climbed, mostly in silence,
speaking now and then some necessary word of
caution, of assent. This way and that Tharon
turned, but always moving upward in the same
direction. From time to time Billy dropped a
shred of the red kerchief about his neck, touched
the soft walls with the handle of the knife he carried.
This left a mark plain as a trail to his
trained eyes.</p>
<p>At noon they halted for a little rest. From
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Tharon&#8217;s saddle Billy had taken the flask of water,
the tightly rolled bundle of bread and meat in its
meal-sack. They ate sparingly of this, drank more
sparingly of the water. Billy wondered miserably
how soon this last might become more precious
than fine gold to him, as he thought of the
waterless pockets of the blind and sliding country.</p>
<p>Long before she had rested sufficiently Tharon
was up and ready to go. Ever her eager eyes
were on the heights above. Ever they turned to
the left of the steady line she set herself through
and above the winding passes. From time to
time Billy looked back. There was not a sign by
which one might tell which way he had come if
the last mark he made was around the first corner.
Hundreds and thousands of spires and faces towered
about them. It was a mystic maze of dead
stone, cut and weathered by the elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder!&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;that the
Indians call it the Enchanted Land!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll reach False Ridge tomorrow, Billy,&#8221;
Tharon told him confidently, &#8220;an&#8217; over it lies
God&#8217;s Cup. There&#8217;s water there&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; Kenset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Just feel. He&#8217;s there&ndash;&ndash;alive
or&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; a half sob clutched at her voice&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;or dead.
But he&#8217;s there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be some one with him if he&#8217;s alive,
most likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Tharon briefly.</p>
<p>All the afternoon they traveled, sometimes
touching with outstretched hands the faces on
either side of them, again walking upward
through majestic halls, solemn and beautiful.
Everything about them was beautiful, the height,
the sheer, straight walls, the myriad little blue
shadows of tiny projections on their faces. Night
came so early in the pits that long before they
wished they were compelled to camp. In a blind
pocket, walled like a room and round as an apple,
they stopped, and Billy spread down the blanket
he had taken from Drumfire&#8217;s back. This was
their only preparation. They had nothing to do,
no fire to build, no water to bring.</p>
<p>Tharon, scarcely conscious of the many miles
she had traveled since the previous night, sat
down upon the blanket, gathered her knees in her
arms and stared at the vague blue phantoms of
cliffs through the tall straight mouth that led into
this sheltered pocket.</p>
<p>Outside the winds were drawing up the ca&ntilde;ons.
All day they had walked in this wind. It drew
constantly up and down the cuts, this way and that,
like contrary currents that met and fought each
other, swung in together, went a little way in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
peace, to again split and surge away through other
channels. The echoes were alive with every sound,
both of their own making and that of the wind&#8217;s.
A constant sighing droned through the depths, a
mournful, whispering sound that sent the shivers
down Tharon&#8217;s spine, made her think sadly of all
the tragedies she had ever known.</p>
<p>Billy, lying full length beside her, his hands
beneath his head, looked up to the narrow blue
spot of sky so far away, and thought his own
thoughts, and they were not wholly sad.</p>
<p>They fell to talking, softly, in low tones, as if
in all the mysterious solitude there might be one
to hear, and it was mostly speech of long ago&ndash;&ndash;when
Billy had first come into Lost Valley.</p>
<p>After a long and quiet hour the man insisted
that she should sleep&ndash;&ndash;that after the hard day and
in view of the coming hard morrow, she needed
rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not tired, Billy,&#8221; Tharon protested,
&#8220;no more&#8217;n as if I&#8217;d been ridin&#8217; all day after th&#8217;
cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Billy shook his head and hollowed a little
place in the soft slide stuff at the Wall&#8217;s foot. In
this he spread the blanket, folding it half back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie down,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;ll be
asleep so quick you won&#8217;t know when it happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tharon slipped off her daddy&#8217;s belt and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
stretched her slim young form in the hollow, which
fitted it like a cradle. Not for nothing had Billy
slept out many a night with nothing save the earth
and stars for bed and blanket. The hollow was
craftily deepened at hip and shoulder, making a
restful couch. As she settled herself therein he
lapped the loose half of the blanket over her and
tucked it in. Then he took his hat, folded it
sharply and placed it under the tawny head.</p>
<p>In its place he would fain have laid his heart.</p>
<p>His fingers, settling the improvised pillow,
tangled themselves wistfully in the sun-bright hair,
and the boy groaned aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Billy, dear?&#8221; asked
Tharon anxiously, but Billy laughed lightly, a thin
sound in the mighty caverns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in God&#8217;s world, Tharon,&#8221; he lied.
&#8220;Now go to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he walked away to the tall mouth and sat
down with his back against one of the walls. From
his pocket he took papers and tobacco and proceeded
to roll himself a cigarette.... Dawn
showed the narrow doorway strewn with their
butts, as leaves strew mountain trails in
autumn.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Things were ready to happen in Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;several
things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>At the Golden Cloud, Lola looked across the
level stretches toward the Stronghold with tragic
dark eyes, and smiled at a dozen men whom she
scarcely saw. Settlers from all up and down the
Wall drifted into Corvan and out again, intent,
silent, watchful. <i>Vaqueros</i> and riders from the
Stronghold also came and went, as intent, as silent.
They passed each other with hostile eyes and trigger
fingers were unusually limber. The air was
pregnant with change.</p>
<p>Buck Courtrey was conspicuous by his absence.</p>
<p>He was not seen in the town, neither was he at
the Stronghold.</p>
<p>There were soft whispers afloat that he was
with the Pomos up under the Rockface at the
north.</p>
<p>And at the Stronghold, poor Ellen, whiter than
ever, more like a broken lily drooping on its stem,
trembled and waited for a day that was set
soon&ndash;&ndash;too terribly soon!&ndash;&ndash;the day, farcically
appointed, for the suit for divorce against
her.</p>
<p>Word of this was abroad through all the Valley.
Underground speculation was rife as to which
of the two women whom Courtrey favoured, Lola
or Tharon, was responsible. Some said one, some
the other. But Lola knew.</p>
<p>Then came the day itself&ndash;&ndash;a golden summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
day as sweet and bright as that one years ago when
Courtrey had married Ellen&ndash;&ndash;at this same pine
building where the laughable legal farces were
enacted now.</p>
<p>Pale as a new moon Ellen rode in across the
rolling stretches on one of the Ironwoods, with
Cleve beside her. She was spiritless, silent. Cleve
was silent, too, though for a far different reason.
There was a frown between his brows, a glitter
in his narrowed eyes. He was thinking of the
only man in Corvan whom he had been able to
persuade to present Ellen&#8217;s protest&ndash;&ndash;Dick Burtree,
one-time lawyer and man of parts in the outside,
now a puffed and threadbare vagabond,
whose paramount idea was whiskey and more
whiskey. But Burtree could talk. Over his
mottled and shapeless lips could, on occasion, pour
a stream of pure oratory silver as the Vestal&#8217;s
Veil.</p>
<p>When he was drunk he feared neither man nor
devil, and he could speak best so. Therefore Cleve
had given him enough money in advance to put him
in trim.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you think Buck&#8217;ll say about me,
Cleve?&#8221; Ellen asked anxiously. &#8220;What&#8217;s he
mean to accuse me of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any dirty thing he can trump up, Sis,&#8221; said
Cleve gravely, &#8220;he&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to make it a nasty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
mess&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I wish to God you&#8217;d jest ride on down
th&#8217; Wall with me an&#8217; never even look back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned from his saddle and took the blue-veined
hand in his. There was an unspeakable
tenderness in his eyes as he regarded his sister.
&#8220;What you say, Ellen? There&#8217;s life below, an&#8217;
work an&#8217; other men. You&#8217;ll marry again, sometime&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Ellen shook her head with its maize-gold
crown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary other man, Cleve,&#8221; she said gently.
&#8220;I&#8217;m all Buck&#8217;s woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they rode on toward the town, and Cleve
knew that his last faint hope was dead.</p>
<p>In the town itself there was a stir. Courtrey
was there, and Wylackie Bob, and Black Bart and
Arizona, a bunch of dark, evil men in all surety.</p>
<p>The Ironwoods were in evidence everywhere,
but strange to say, there were no Finger Marks.
Not a man from the Holding was in town.</p>
<p>When Cleve and Ellen, alone together, rode in,
it lacked yet a half hour of the time set for trial.
There was no place to go but Baston&#8217;s, so they
dismounted at the hitch-rack. Ellen, swaying on
her feet, looked all around with her big pale eyes,
and when she saw Courtrey some distance away
she put a hand to her heart as simply as a hurt
child. She was a pitiful creature in her long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
white dress, for she had ridden in on an old sidesaddle,
and she shook out the crumpled folds in
a wistful attempt to look proper. On her head
was the inevitable sunbonnet of slats and calico.</p>
<p>As she went up the steps of the store with Cleve,
Lola of the Golden Cloud, blazing like a comet
in her red-and-black came face to face with her
purposely. What was in Lola&#8217;s head none would
ever know, but she wanted to see Courtrey&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>As they met they stopped dead still, these two
women who loved one man, and the look that
passed between them was electric, deep, revealing.
They stood so long staring into each other&#8217;s eyes
that Cleve, frowning, plucked Ellen by the sleeve
and made to push forward.</p>
<p>But as suddenly as a flash of light Lola reached
out her two hands and caught Ellen&#8217;s in a tight
clasp that only women know, the swift, clinging
clasp of the secret fellowship of those who suffer.</p>
<p>For one tense moment she held them, while
Ellen swayed forward for all the world as if she
would sink in upon the deep full breast of this
wanton whom she had hated! Then the spell
broke, they fell apart with a rush, Lola swung out
and went down the steps, while Ellen obediently
followed Cleve into Baston&#8217;s store, where she sat
on a nail keg and waited in a dull lethargy. Outside
Courtrey, who had witnessed the thing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
across the street, slapped his thigh and laughed
uproariously.</p>
<p>It was a funny sight to him. But Lola&#8217;s beautiful
black eyes blazed across at him with a light
that none had ever seen before in their inscrutable
depths.</p>
<p>Then the hour struck, and all Corvan, it seemed
to Cleve, strung out toward the Court House.
This was to be in open court&ndash;&ndash;a spectacle. From
somewhere in the adobe outskirts of the town came
Ellen&#8217;s serving women, most of them, whom Cleve
had sent in early in the day. They fell in with her
and so, with only the brother who had never failed
her and these dusky women of the silent tongues
to back her, Ellen Courtrey went to her crucifixion
as truly as though she had been one of the two
thieves on Golgotha.</p>
<p>At the sight of Courtrey across the big bare
room she went whiter than she was, if such a
thing were possible, and slid weakly into the chair
placed for her.</p>
<p>Then the thing proceeded&ndash;&ndash;swiftly, lightly, with
smiles on the faces of the crowd.</p>
<p>Old Ben Garland on the judge&#8217;s bench,
was furtive, scared, nervous, fiddling with his
papers and clearing his throat from time to
time.</p>
<p>The county clerk at his table made a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
deal out of the ceremony of swearing in the witnesses&ndash;&ndash;Wylackie
Bob, Black Bart, Arizona and
one young Wylackie Indian woman who worked
at the Stronghold. Cleve put up only the serving
women whom he had sent in, some seven of them,
every one of whom loved their mistress with the
faithful fidelity of a dog. These women knew
Ellen Courtrey as not even the master of the
Stronghold himself knew her. They knew her in
her idle hours, at her small tasks, at her bedside,
in the loving solicitude she displayed for all of
them&ndash;&ndash;and they knew her on her knees in prayer,
for Ellen had a strange and simple religion, half
Catholic and half Pomo paganism.</p>
<p>In the straight-backed chair they gave her Ellen
sat like a statue, sweet and still, a thing so obviously
good that it seemed even Courtrey himself
must weaken to behold her. But not Courtrey.
He was on fire with the vision of Tharon Last on
the Cup Rim&#8217;s floor, shaking her fist toward him
in challenge&ndash;&ndash;at Baston&#8217;s steps calling him a murderer
and worse&ndash;&ndash;at her western door, striking
him from her with the strength of a man. He saw
the signal fire flaring across the darkened Valley&ndash;&ndash;and
nothing on earth or in Heaven could have
softened him to the woman who bound him away
from this fighting girl, this gun woman whom he
was breaking to him slowly but surely. He visioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
her in Ellen&#8217;s room at the Stronghold&ndash;&ndash;and
the breath came fast in his throat.</p>
<p>And Ellen?</p>
<p>Ah, Ellen was thinking of the long past day
when this man had found her in the barren rocklands
and taken her with the high hand of a lover.
She, too, drifted away from the chilling courtroom
with its judge and its petty officials.... And then
all suddenly she knew that men were talking&ndash;&ndash;and
about her. She heard the drone of question
and answer&ndash;&ndash;the rambling statements of the
stranger, Arizona, accusing her of strange things&ndash;&ndash;of
asking him to take her on rides in Courtrey&#8217;s
absence&ndash;&ndash;of swinging with him nights in the hammock
by the watering trough!</p>
<p>She sat and listened with parted lips and large
innocent eyes fixed on the man in wonder. Cleve
Whitmore clenched his hands until the nails cut
deep, but he held his tongue and controlled his
face. Only the blazing blue eyes spoke. She
knew that Black Bart tried to tell something, that
he made some mistake or other and had to begin
all over again. There was a long and tedious time
in here when she looked away out the window to
where the prairie grass was blowing in the little
winds and the shadows of clouds drifted across
the green expanse.... She was numb and far
away with misery. She did not care for anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
in all this world. It seemed as if she was detached,
aloof, dead already in body as she was in
soul.... And then she heard the drawling voice
of Wylackie Bob&ndash;&ndash;and he was saying something
unspeakable&ndash;&ndash;about her! She listened like one in
a trance&ndash;&ndash;then she struggled up from her chair
with tragic long arms extended, and the cry that
rang from her lips was piteous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; it pealed across the stillness of the
crowded room, &#8220;Buck!&ndash;&ndash;it ain&#8217;t so! Never in
this world, Buck! I ben true to you as your
shadow! Before God, it ain&#8217;t true!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stir throughout the crowd, a breath
that was audible. There were many of the Vigilantes
there&ndash;&ndash;a goodly number, all wondering
where Tharon Last was, where Kenset was, where
were the riders from Last&#8217;s. They had expected,
what they did not know&ndash;&ndash;something, at any rate,
for this seemed somehow a test, a turning point.
But there was nothing. They stirred and waited,
like a great force heaving in its bed, blind, sluggish,
but wakening.</p>
<p>And Ellen, chilled by Courtrey&#8217;s sneering face,
the cold disapproval of Ben Garland&#8217;s striking
mallet, sank back in her chair and covered her
face with her shaking hands.... She heard
some more awful things&ndash;&ndash;then the voice of Dick
Burtree beginning soft, low, silver like running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
waters. She heard it tell of that far away day of
her marriage&ndash;&ndash;of the years that followed&ndash;&ndash;of
Courtrey&#8217;s love for her&ndash;&ndash;of her own gentleness,
her beauty, &#8220;like the tender sunlight of spring
on the snow and the golden sands&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;of her service,
her loyalty, her love that had &#8220;never faltered
nor intruded&#8221; that &#8220;patient obedience to
her master had but strengthened and made perfect.&#8221;
Of the pitiful thing that her life had been
this man made a wondrous thing, all sweet with
twilights and haloed with service.</p>
<p>He talked until the courtroom was still as death
and the Indian women behind her were rocking
in unison of grief. Then she heard questions
again and the gutteral soft voices of her women
answering&ndash;&ndash;with love and devotion in every halting
word. Once again the crowd in the room
stirred&ndash;&ndash;and Courtrey&#8217;s narrow eyes went over it
in that cold, promising glance.</p>
<p>For once in his life Courtrey, the bully, felt a
premonitory chill down his spine&ndash;&ndash;because for the
first time that promising glance of his failed of its
effect! Only here and there along the rows of
faces did one cower. There were faces, many
faces, that looked back at him with steady eyes
and tight lips.... Verily it was time he conquered
the riding, shooting, beautiful she-devil
who had made this thing possible! The sooner he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
got Tharon Last away from this bunch of spawn
the better. Then he would sweep in with all his
old swift methods, only sharper ones this time,
and &#8220;clean&#8221; them all. When he got through it
would be a different man&#8217;s Valley, make no mistake
about that!</p>
<p>Here Ellen looked straight into his eyes and
both were conscious of the shock. Ellen wilted
and Courtrey frowned and struck a fist against
the railing near him.... He looked up and met
the hesitating eyes of Ben Garland on the bench
and his own hardened down to pin points.</p>
<p>The farce was finished save for the Judge&#8217;s
decision&ndash;&ndash;Dick Burtree was slumped in his chair,
dead drunk and asleep. Wylackie Bob was lighting
a cigarette in his brown fingers, a smile on his
evil mouth, his slow, black eyes covering the slim
white form of Ellen in a speculative way, as if he
dreamed of making true his blasphemous lies.
Ellen was sweet as a flower in her open-lipped
beauty, her panting despair. Wylackie did not
notice the slim man beside her whose lips were so
tight that they were a mere line across his face.
No one at the Stronghold noticed Cleve much.</p>
<p>Then Ben Garland was speaking, and Ellen
gathered her dim wits enough to make out that
he was saying strange things&ndash;&ndash;awful things&ndash;&ndash;that
had to do with Courtrey&#8217;s freedom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Then she knew&ndash;&ndash;swaying and groping with her
blue-veined hands&ndash;&ndash;that the thing was done&ndash;&ndash;that
she was no longer a wife. That she would never
again sleep in the bend of Courtrey&#8217;s arm as she
had slept in those golden days of long ago&ndash;&ndash;that
she was an outcast, blackened beyond all hope by
the damning and unchoice words of Wylackie Bob....
Then the world faded out for Ellen in merciful
blackness.</p>
<p>The petty officials rose with laughter and clanking
of boots on the board floors&ndash;&ndash;the crowd filed
out in a striking silence. Never before had a
crowd in Lost Valley gone out from a courtroom
in that strange and bodeful silence.</p>
<p>The sight of Ellen lying white and limp across
Cleve Whitmore&#8217;s shoulder like a sack of grain,
as he passed out with the moving mass, had an
odd effect. It was partly the white dress that did
it&ndash;&ndash;and the time was ripe.</p>
<p>Courtrey and his gang were toward the fore&ndash;&ndash;first
out. They spread off to one side with jest
and quip, with flash of bottle and slap on shoulder.
The populace thinned a bit from the steps....
And then suddenly as a pistol shot Cleve Whitmore&#8217;s
voice rang out like a clarion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wylackie!&#8221; it pealed across the subdued
noises, &#8220;You &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; hell hound.
<i>Turn round!</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>There was death in it.</p>
<p>The gun man whirled, drawing like lightning.
In the Court House door, Cleve Whitmore with his
sister&#8217;s limp form on his shoulder, beat him to it.</p>
<p>He had drawn as he called. Before the words
were off his lips he pulled the trigger and shot
Wylackie through the heart.</p>
<p>As his henchman fell Courtrey&#8217;s good hand
flashed to his hip, but Dixon of the Vigilantes,
shot out an arm and knocked him forward from
behind.</p>
<p>For the second time Courtrey had missed a life
because a brave heart dared him. Old Pete had
paid the price for that trick. Dixon had no
thought of it.</p>
<p>And in one moment the chance was past, for a
sound began to roar from that silent crowd which
had poured from the courtroom&ndash;&ndash;the deep, bloodcurdling
sound of the mob forming, inarticulate,
uncertain.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life Courtrey felt real
fear grip him.</p>
<p>He had killed and stolen and wronged among
these people and gotten away with it. He had
never feared them. They had been silent. Now
with the first deep rumble from the concrete throat
of Lost Valley he got his first instinctive thrill of
disaster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>He stood for a moment in utter silence. Then
he flung up his hands, snapped out an order,
whirled on his heel and went swiftly to the near
rack where stood Bolt and the rest of the Ironwoods.
Like a set of puppets on strings his men
drew after him&ndash;&ndash;and they left Wylackie Bob
where he fell.</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds the whole Stronghold
gang was mounted and clattering down the street&ndash;&ndash;out
of the town toward the open range.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And the killer on the Court House steps?</p>
<p>He stood where he was and looked with blazing
eyes over the motley crowd beneath him.
Steptoe Service made a step toward him, looked
round, wet his lips and thought better of it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And then, in another second, the crowd was a
mob and the mob was the Vigilantes. Some one
took Ellen from Cleve&#8217;s shoulder with careful
hands and carried her away. Then some one
reached down and picked him up bodily. Another
joined, and they set him on their shoulders, lifting
him high. The inarticulate mob cry swelled and
deepened and rose to a different sound&ndash;&ndash;a shout
that gathered volume and roared out across the
spaces where Courtrey rode with a menace, a
portent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>With one accord the mob started on a journey
around Corvan.</p>
<p>White as Ellen, Cleve Whitmore rode that triumphant
journey, his eyes still blazing, his lips
tight. The town went wild. Public feeling came
out on every hand. Daring took the weak,
hope took the oppressed, and they called Courtrey&#8217;s
reign right there. For three uproarious
hours the bar-tenders could not wipe off their
bars.</p>
<p>A new regime was ushered in&ndash;&ndash;and she who
had been its sponsor was not there to see it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the hour of Change was striking for Corvan
and all Lost Valley, Tharon Last, who had set
it to strike, was scaling False Ridge in the Ca&ntilde;on
Country. Grim, ash-pale with effort, her blue
eyes shining, she climbed the Secret Way that
few had ever found.</p>
<p>How she had come to it through the tortuous
cuts and passes was a marvel of homing instinct&ndash;&ndash;the
heart that homed to its object. It had seemed
to her all along this strange, tense journey, that
she had had no will of her own, that she had held
her breath and shut her eyes, as it were, and gone
forward in obedience to some strange thing within
that said, &#8220;turn here,&#8221; &#8220;go thus.&#8221; Billy following
behind, watched her with tight lips and a secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
wonder. As she had told him she would &#8220;go
straight, Mary willing,&#8221; so she had gone straight&ndash;&ndash;and
it seemed, truly, as if it were right that
she should, no matter how his heart ached to see
this thing.</p>
<p>Verily there was something supernatural about
it all, something uncanny.</p>
<p>If it had been he, Billy, whom Tharon loved,
and had he lain, wounded in the Cup o&#8217; God,
would the girl have been given this blind instinct
for direction? Would she have gone as unerringly
to the Secret Way?</p>
<p>Nay&ndash;&ndash;there must be something in the old saying
that, for every heart in the world there was its
true mate.</p>
<p>Tharon had found hers in Kenset.</p>
<p>But where would he ever find his? The boy
shook his fair head hopelessly at the sliding floors.
For all perfection there must be sacrifice. He was
the sacrifice for Tharon&#8217;s perfection&ndash;&ndash;a willing
one, so help him!</p>
<p>That they had found the Secret Way across
False Ridge was perfectly plain, for here in the
living rock before them were marks, the first
marks they had found in the Ca&ntilde;ons. Thin, small
crosses, cut in the stone of the walls, began to lead
upward from the last liftings cut straight up the
Rockface of False Ridge itself. It seemed, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
look at the dim traces, that no living thing without
wings could scale that steep and forbidding cliff,
but when they tried to climb, they found that each
step had been set with artful cunning. The set
of steps followed the form of a &#8220;switchback,&#8221;
working from right to left, and always rising a
little. False Ridge itself, a towering, mighty
spine, came down in a swiftly dropping ridge from
somewhere in the high upper country at the west
of all the ca&ntilde;ons. It was known to lead deceptively
down among the cuts and passes, as if it
went straight down to the lower levels, and to end
abruptly in a precipice that none could descend or
climb. On all its rugged sides there were treacherous
slopes which looked hard enough to support
a man, but which, once stepped on, gave sickeningly
away to slide and slither for a hundred feet
straight down to some abrupt edge, where they
fell in dusty cataracts to blind basins and walled
cups below.</p>
<p>In these blind cups were many skeletons of deer
and other animals that had ventured down from
the upper world, never to return. Somewhere up
here must be the bones of Ca&ntilde;on Jim.</p>
<p>But the Secret Way was safe. Under every
carefully worked out step there was solid stone,
for every handhold there was a firm stake set.
These stakes were old for the most part, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
here and there had been set in a new one&ndash;&ndash;Courtrey&#8217;s
work, they made no doubt, for Courtrey was
said to know the Ca&ntilde;ons. It took Tharon and
Billy two hours to make the climb, stopping from
time to time to rest. At such times the boy
stood close and took her hand. It was grim work
looking down the sheer face, and one might well
be excused for holding a hand for steadiness. And
it would soon be the time for no more touches of
this girl&#8217;s fair self for Billy.</p>
<p>And so, climbing steadily and in comparative
silence, these two, whose hearts were strong, came
at last to the top of False Ridge&ndash;&ndash;a thin knife-blade
of stone&ndash;&ndash;and looked abruptly and suddenly
down on the other side.</p>
<p>With a little gasp Tharon put a hand to her
throat, for there, an unbelievably short distance
down, lay the Cup o&#8217; God, without a doubt. A
small, round glade of living green, watered by a
whispering stream that lost itself the Lord knew
where, it lay like a tiny gem in the pink stone setting.
Trees stood in utter quiet about its edges,
for there was here no slightest breath of air. Lush
grass carpeted its level floor. And there, almost
directly under the marked way leading down,
lay a tiny camp&ndash;&ndash;the ashes of a dead fire, a
gun against a tree, and&ndash;&ndash;here Tharon leaned far
out and looked as if her very spirit would penetrate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
the distance&ndash;&ndash;a blanket spread on the level
earth, on which there lay the body of a man!</p>
<p>It was a trim body, they could see from where
they stood, clad in dark garments of olive drab
that hugged the lean limbs close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenset!&#8221; whispered Tharon with paling lips.
&#8220;Kenset of th&#8217; foothills,&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;looks,&#8221; she
wet those ashy lips, &#8220;he&ndash;&ndash;looks like he is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without another word she set her feet in the
precarious way and went down so fast that Billy&#8217;s
heart rose in his throat and choked him, and for
the first time since he could remember, he called
fervently upon his Maker with honest reverence.
He thought at every slip and scramble that she
must fall and go hurtling down the Rockface.</p>
<p>But that uncanny instinct which had brought
her this far was at her command still. She went
down faster than it seemed possible for anything
to go, and before the rider was able to catch up
she had leaped to the grassy floor, and was running
forward toward that still form on the
blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenset!&#8221; she cried like a bugle, &#8220;Kenset!
Kenset! Oh,&ndash;&ndash;David!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then it was that the quiet form stirred,
rolled over on its side, lifted itself on an elbow&ndash;&ndash;and
held out two arms that wavered grotesquely,
but were eloquent of love&#8217;s power and its need.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>And the Mistress of Last&#8217;s flung herself on her
knees, gathered up this strange man as if he had
been a child, pressed him hard against her breast,
and kissed him as we kiss our dead. She pushed
his face from her and looked into it as if she
would see his very soul, the tears running on her
white cheeks, her lips working soundlessly.</p>
<p>This was love! This agony&ndash;&ndash;this ecstasy&ndash;&ndash;this
sublime forgetting of all the world beside&ndash;&ndash;this
reward after struggle.</p>
<p>Billy stood for a second at the foot of the Wall,
and the nails cut in his palms. Then he whirled
and went fast as he could walk toward the first
trees that presented themselves&ndash;&ndash;and he could not
see where he was going for the bleak grey mist
that swam in his eyes.</p>
<p>This was love! This dreary colour of the
golden sunlight of noon in the high country&ndash;&ndash;this
dumb ache that locked his throat&ndash;&ndash;this high courage
that brought him serving love&#8217;s object to the
bitter-sweet end. How long he stood there he did
not know. His heart was dead, like the weathered
stone country about him. He knew that he heard
Tharon&#8217;s voice after a while, that golden voice
which had been the bells of Last&#8217;s, in rapid question
and answer&ndash;&ndash;and Kenset&#8217;s voice, too, weak
and slow, but filled with joy unspeakable. It was
lilting and soft, a lover&#8217;s voice, a victor&#8217;s voice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
and presently he caught a few of the broken words
that passed between them&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Clean! Clean! Oh,
Tharon, darling&ndash;&ndash;there is no blood on these dear
hands! Tell me you did not kill Courtrey!&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard Tharon answer in the negative.</p>
<p>And then all the world fell about him, it seemed,
for a gun cracked from the trees beyond him and
a wasp stung his cheek.</p>
<p>In one instant the sunlight became brilliant
again, the joy came back in the day. Here was
something more to do for Tharon, a new task at
hand when he had thought his tasks were all but
done.</p>
<p>He whirled, looked, drew his six-gun and began
firing at the man who stood in plain sight just
where he had stepped into the Cup from the mouth
of a little blind cut where the stream went out in
noise and lost itself.</p>
<p>This was a big man, sinister and cold and dark,
a half-breed Pomo of Courtrey&#8217;s gang, a still-hunter
who did a lot of the dirty work which the
others refused. Billy had seen him before, knew
his record.</p>
<p>Now they two stood face to face and fired at
each other swiftly, coolly. He saw the half-breed
stagger once, knew that he had touched him somewhere.
And then a sound cut into the snapping of
the shots, a sound that was like nothing he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
ever heard in all his life before, a sound as savage
as the roar of a she-bear whose cub is killed before
her eyes. As he flung away his empty gun and
snatched the other, he moved enough to bring into
his range of vision Tharon Last, standing over
Kenset, her mouth open in that savage cry.</p>
<p>Then before he could draw and fire again he
saw the prettiest piece of work he had ever witnessed.
He saw the gun woman crouch and stoop,
saw her hands flash in Jim Last&#8217;s famous backhand
flip, saw the red flame spurt from her hips,
and the Pomo half-breed flung up his hands and
fell in a heap, his face in the grass. He did not
move. Only a long ripple passed over his body.
He was still as the ageless rocks, as much a part
of eternity. For a moment Billy stood, the gun
hanging in his hand. Then he knew that Tharon
was coming toward him&ndash;&ndash;that her hands were on
his shoulders&ndash;&ndash;her deep eyes piercing his with a
look that meant more to him than all the earth
beside. It was the fierce, mother-look of changeless
affection, the companion to that savage cry.
She held him in a pinching grip, and made sure
that he was unhurt, save for that scratch on the
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had killed you, Billy,&#8221; she said tensely,
&#8220;I&#8217;d a-gone a-muck an&#8217; shot up th&#8217; whole of Lost
Valley.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>And the boy knew in his heart she spoke the
solemn truth.</p>
<p>He slipped his hands down her arms and
caught her fingers tightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stained!&#8221; his heart whispered to itself in
stifling exhilaration, &#8220;in spite of all&ndash;&ndash;her first
killin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he could bear her face no more, and
turned to look at Kenset. Half off the edge of his
blanket the forest man lay with his face buried
in his hands, and beside him lay another gun, the
smoke still curling from its muzzle.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; said the rider, softly, &#8220;what&#8217;s
this?&#8221; and he ran forward to pick up the weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three of us!&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;pepperin&#8217; him
at once! Kenset, where did you get this gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Kenset did not speak. His shoulders
trembled, his dark head was bowed to the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;for as sure&#8217;s I live,
this here&#8217;s Buck Courtrey&#8217;s favourite gun&ndash;&ndash;the
gun with the untrue firin&#8217; pin. Look here.&#8221; And
he held it toward Tharon who leaned near to look.
True enough.</p>
<p>In the right side of the plunger there was a
small, shining nick, as if, at some previous time,
a tiny chink had been broken out of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it where I saw Courtrey hide it that
night they brought me here,&#8221; said Kenset in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
muffled voice. &#8220;I crawled when the Pomo was
out in the Ca&ntilde;ons after meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you used it&ndash;&ndash;at last. I see. Not till th&#8217;
last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kenset miserably, &#8220;not till the
last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly Tharon knelt down beside him and put a
tender arm across his shoulders. Her face was
shining&ndash;&ndash;like Billy&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenset,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;I told you
once that I was afraid you was soft&ndash;&ndash;like a woman&ndash;&ndash;that
you wouldn&#8217;t shoot if you had a gun. An&#8217;
you said, &#8216;You&#8217;re right. I wouldn&#8217;t. Not until
th&#8217; last extremity.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was this last extremity? Tell me. Why
did you shoot when you knew right well I&#8217;d get
him myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To beat you to it!&#8221; cried the man with sudden
passion, &#8220;to take the stain myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long moment the girl knelt there beside
him and gazed unseeingly at the inscrutable calm
of the silent country. Something in the depths
of her blue eyes was changing&ndash;&ndash;deepening, growing
in subtle beauty, as if the universe was suddenly
become perfect, as if there was nowhere a
flaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one kind of man, after all, Mr.
Kenset,&#8221; she said at last with a sweet dignity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
&#8220;th&#8217; man who is true an&#8217; honest to th&#8217; best there
is in him, accordin&#8217; to his lights. That&#8217;s my kind
of man.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Then she rose, and it was as if a light of activity
burned up in her. She became practical on the
instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you brought th&#8217; thin rope, Billy,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;it&#8217;s longer&#8217;n mine. An&#8217; th&#8217; little axe, too.
We&#8217;ll need &#8217;em all to get him up an&#8217; down False
Ridge. An&#8217; we must get busy right pronto. Th&#8217;
Pomo killer we&#8217;ll leave where he is. The Ca&ntilde;on
Country will make him a silent grave.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FINGER MARK AND IRONWOOD AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>It was another noon in Lost Valley. The
summer sun sailed the azure skies in majesty.
Little soft winds from the south wimpled the
grass of the rolling ranges, shook all the leaves
of the poplars. Down the face of the Wall the
Vestal&#8217;s Veil shimmered and shone like a million
miles of lace.</p>
<p>At Corvan wild excitement ruled. Swift things
had come upon them, things that staggered the
tight-lipped community, even though it was used to
speed and tragedy. For one thing, Ellen, pale,
sweet flower, had hanged herself in the gaudy
apartment of Lola behind the Golden Cloud
where the dance-hall woman had peremptorily
brought her when they took her off Cleve Whitmore&#8217;s
shoulder. She left a little note for Courtrey,
a pathetic short scrawl, which simply reiterated
that she had &#8220;ben true to him as his
shadow,&#8221; and that if he did no longer want her,
she did not want herself.</p>
<p>At that pitiful end to a guiltless life, Lola, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
knew innocence and sin, sat down on the only carpeted
floor in Corvan and wept. When she finished,
she was done with Corvan and Lost Valley,
ready to move on as she had moved through an
eventful life.</p>
<p>For another thing, two strange men had ridden
up the Wall from the Bottle Neck a few days
back, and they had put through some mysterious
doings.</p>
<p>This day at noon these two strangers were riding
down on Corvan from up the Pomo way,
while from the Stronghold, Buck Courtrey&#8217;s men
were thundering in with the cattle king at their
head. He was grim and silent, black with gathering
rage. His news-veins tapped the Valley, he
knew a deal that others tried to hide, and he was
coming in to reach a savage hand once more toward
that supremacy which he knew full well to
be slipping from him.</p>
<p>And from the blind mouth in the Rockface at
the west where the roofed cut led to the mystery
and the grandeur of the Ca&ntilde;on Country, a strange
procession came slowly out to crawl across the
green expanse&ndash;&ndash;a woman on a silver horse, a
rider on a red roan who sat behind the saddle
and bore in his arms a man whose heavy head
lolled upon his shoulder in all but mortal weakness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>Thus Fate, who had for so long played with
life and death in Lost Valley, tiring of the play,
drew in the strings of the puppets and set the
stage for the last act.</p>
<p>As Tharon and Billy crept up to Baston&#8217;s store
and stopped at the steps, a dozen eager men leaped
forward to their help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy!&#8221; warned the girl. &#8220;He&#8217;s ben hurt
a long time, an&#8217; he&#8217;s had an awful trip. There&#8217;s
fever in him, an&#8217; th&#8217; wound in his shoulder opened
a bit with th&#8217; haulin&#8217;. Lay him down on th&#8217;
porch a while to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Kenset opened his dark eyes with the old
quiet smile and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worth a dozen dead men yet, Miss Last,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>As he lay, a trim, long figure in his semi-military
garments, on the edge of the porch, the populace
of Corvan streamed in from the outskirts and
gathered in the open street. Whispers and comments
were rife among them, a new courage was
noticeable everywhere. The Vigilantes were
present, many of them.</p>
<p>Question and answer passed swiftly and quietly
back and forth between Dixon, Jameson, Hill and
Tharon. In a few pregnant moments she knew
what had happened in Corvan&ndash;&ndash;they knew the
secret of False Ridge and the Cup o&#8217; God.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now these strangers from below&ndash;&ndash;they
ben a-actin&#8217; awful queer, ain&#8217;t a-feared o&#8217; nothin&#8217;
an&#8217; they ben goin&#8217; all over like a couple o&#8217; hounds.
One of &#8217;em&#8217;s got on a badge of some sort,&#8221; said
Jameson, &#8220;didn&#8217;t mean t&#8217; show it, I allow, but
Hill, here, seen it by chanct&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenset raised himself quickly on an elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all that&#8217;s lucky!&#8221; he said softly, excitedly.
&#8220;Burn-Harris and O&#8217;Hallan! My Secret Service
men!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And it was even so, for by the end of another
hour the two strangers came riding in and were
brought forward to the steps where Kenset lay,
to clasp his hand and greet him with all the
pleasure of previous acquaintance.</p>
<p>Then they requested that a space be cleared to
the end of ear-shot and together with Kenset,
Tharon, Billy, and all the Vigilantes, they held a
long and earnest colloquy.</p>
<p>At its end Kenset&#8217;s eyes were deep and troubled,
but Tharon&#8217;s were beginning to glow with the old
fire that all the Holding knew, the leaping flame
that rose and died and rose again, exciting to the
beholder, promising, threatening, unfathomable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a cinch!&#8221; said O&#8217;Hallan, &#8220;a dead
moral cinch! Don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s held on like it has.
Couldn&#8217;t have in any other place in the good old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. but this God forsaken hole! Well named,
Lost Valley! Why, we&#8217;ve found enough evidence
already to convict a dozen men! Your Courtrey&#8217;s
the man that planned a dozen murders, I can see
that, and he&#8217;s pulled off a lot of them himself.
The people are talking now, rumbling from one
end of the Valley to the other. We&#8217;ve had to hold
up our hands to ward them off lately. Your Vigilantes
here have opened up since we got them
together and showed some of them your letter.
You were wise to tell us to go ahead if you were
not here&ndash;&ndash;what did you look for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about what I got,&#8221; said Kenset smiling,
&#8220;and I wanted things to be pushed through anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re pushing,&#8221; said Burn-Harris.
&#8220;Your little old sheriff has had the fear-of-the-Lord
put into him somewhat. He&#8217;s shaking in
his boots about the snow-packer. There&#8217;s only
one thing lacking to make our grip close down on
Courtrey, and that&#8217;s vital&ndash;&ndash;the gun with the untrue
firing pin you speak about in your instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not lackin&#8217;,&#8221; said Tharon grimly, &#8220;we&#8217;ve
got it, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Secret Service man whirled to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have?&#8221; he cried, &#8220;then show me your
man!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>But Tharon stood for a long moment looking
off across the rolling green stretches, toward the
north where a moving dot was drawing down&ndash;&ndash;the
riders from the Stronghold.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; she said at last, tapping the gun which
Billy handed over, &#8220;this, then, is proof&ndash;&ndash;is proof
in law?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the true gun that fits the shell which
Mr. Kenset left for us here at Baston&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Burn-Harris, &#8220;a little time and
your man&#8217;s ours as sure&#8217;s the sun shines. Why,
this is a hot-bed of crime&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s enough work
here to keep a whole force busy for months.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tharon Last did not heed his words. Her
mind had leaped away from the present back to
that day in spring when Jim Last came home to
die. She heard again his last command, &#8220;Th&#8217;
best gun woman in Lost Valley,&#8221; heard her own
voice promising to his dulling ears, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get him,
so help me, God!&#8221;</p>
<p>And this was the end. Strangers were waiting
to fulfill that promise, to take her work out of her
hands. She absently watched the moving dot take
form and sharply string out into a line of riding
men. These strangers with their hidden signs of
authority would bring to his just desserts Buck
Courtrey, the man who had instigated the killing
of poor Harkness, who had personally shot her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
daddy in the back! For them, then, she had made
her crosses of promise in the granite under the
pointing pine.</p>
<p>They who had no right in Lost Valley would
settle its blood scores, would pay her debts!</p>
<p>She frowned and the fingers of her right hand
fiddled at the gun-butt at her hip.</p>
<p>For what had she striven all these many
months? For what had she perfected herself in
Jim Last&#8217;s art?</p>
<p>A little white line drew in about her lips, the
flame in her blue eyes leaped and flickered. The
tawny brows gathered into a puckered frown.</p>
<p>Billy, watching, moved restlessly on his booted
feet. He it was who saw&ndash;&ndash;who feared. He
touched her wrist with timid fingers and she
flashed him a swift glance that half melted to a
smile. Then she forgot him and all the rest&ndash;&ndash;for
the Ironwoods were thundering in from the
outside levels, were coming into town.</p>
<p>Ahead rode Courtrey, big, black, keen, his wide
hat swept back on his iron-grey hair, an imposing
presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your man!&#8221; said Kenset softly, rising
excitedly on his elbow. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming! And
God grant that there is no bloodshed!&#8221;</p>
<p>All of Corvan, so long meek and quiet under
Courtrey&#8217;s foot, moved dramatically back to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
him room to come thundering down to his accounting.</p>
<p>In a few seconds he would be encompassed by
his enemies.</p>
<p>And then, on the tick of fate, that universally
unknown factor, a woman&#8217;s heart, flung its last
pawn in the balance.</p>
<p>Lola, gleaming like a bird of paradise in her gay
habiliments, leaning forward from the further
steps of Baston&#8217;s store where she had slipped up
unnoticed, cupped her white hands to her scarlet
mouth, and sent out a cry like a clarion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; she called, bell-like, clear, far-reaching&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Buck!
Turn back! They&#8217;ve called your
turn! It&#8217;s all up for you! Go! Go&ndash;&ndash;down&ndash;&ndash;the
Wall! And&ndash;&ndash;God bless you&ndash;&ndash;Buck! Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>For one awful moment the great red Ironwood,
Bolt, flung up his head and slid forward on his
haunches, ploughing up the earth in a cloud.</p>
<p>Then, while the half-stunned crowd gaped in
silence, he gathered himself, straightened, whirled,
shook his giant frame and leaped clear of the
ground in a spectacular turn. The man on his
back snatched off his hat and shook it defiantly at
the town&ndash;&ndash;the people&ndash;&ndash;the very Valley that he
had ruled so long. It was a dramatic gesture&ndash;&ndash;daring,
scorning, renouncing. Then, without a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
word to his henchmen, a single look of farewell,
Buck Courtrey struck the Ironwood, and was gone
back along the little street.</p>
<p>His men whirled after him, but strange turn of
destiny, they swung directly north away from him,
for he was turning south at the town&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the&ndash;&ndash;Wall!&#8221; breathed Lola, her face like
milk, one hand on her glittering breast. &#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;goes&ndash;&ndash;for
below!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then all the watchers knew the same.</p>
<p>The master of the Stronghold, having played
for Lost Valley and for a woman and lost them
both&ndash;&ndash;was done with both.</p>
<p>He leaned on the Ironwood&#8217;s mighty neck and
went south toward the Bottle Neck.</p>
<p>All eyes were upon him&ndash;&ndash;all, that is, save the
earnest grey ones of Billy Brent. They were
fixed in anguish on the face of Tharon Last beside
him&ndash;&ndash;Tharon Last, who shoved the gun-butts hard
down in the holsters at her hips, who whirled on
her booted heel, who cleared the space between
her and El Rey in three cat-like leaps.</p>
<p>As she went up the stallion rose with her, came
down with a pounding of iron-shod hoofs,
dropped his huge hips in the first leap&ndash;&ndash;and was
away.</p>
<p>Corvan saw the silver horse shoot out from its
midst and woke from its lethargy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Th&#8217; race!</i>&#8221; some one cried, high and shrill,
&#8220;<i>th&#8217; race at last!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The two strangers saw it, and their lips fell
open with amaze.</p>
<p>Kenset from his low porch saw it&ndash;&ndash;and dropped
his face on his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord God!&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;it&#8217;s come! I
couldn&#8217;t hold her! I might have known! I might
have known! She&#8217;s Valley bred&ndash;&ndash;she <i>is</i> the Valley!
I&ndash;&ndash;and all I stand for&ndash;&ndash;chaff in the wind!
Nothing could hold her now! Aye&ndash;&ndash;nothing could
hold her.&#8221;</p>
<p>True at last to herself&ndash;&ndash;true to Harkness&ndash;&ndash;true
to Jim Last&ndash;&ndash;true to the Vigilantes and to the
Valley she loved, Tharon flung the sombrero from
her bright head, settled her feet in the stirrups,
slid the rein on El Rey&#8217;s neck, leaned down above
him and began to call in his ears.</p>
<p>No need of that cry.</p>
<p>El Rey heeded nothing that she might say. She
was not his master&ndash;&ndash;never had been. He had had
but one, the big, stern man whose sharp word had
been his law&ndash;&ndash;the one who had ever had his best,
his love and his speed.</p>
<p>What was it now that rode in his saddle&ndash;&ndash;the
saddle with the long dark stain?</p>
<p>Assuredly it was not the slim girl-thing with the
golden voice!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>El Rey had ever looked through, beyond her.</p>
<p>Nay, it was something bigger, stronger,
sterner&ndash;&ndash;who shall say? Perhaps the spirit of
that master whom he had served, whom he had
brought faithfully home that night in spring, for
whom he had looked and listened all these weary
months! There was something, indeed&ndash;&ndash;for El
Rey, the great, lay down to earth and ran without
the need of guidance. He set the long red horse
out there on the green plain before him like a
beacon and put the mighty machinery of his massive
body into motion. Bolt was a rival worthy of
his best&ndash;&ndash;Bolt, the king of the Ironwoods, huge,
spirited, fast as the wind and wild as fire. El
Rey&#8217;s silver ears lay back along his neck, the mane
above them was like a cloud, his long tail streamed
behind him like a comet&ndash;&ndash;and forgotten was his
singlefooting. He ran, his great limbs gathering
and spreading beneath him&ndash;&ndash;gathering and
spreading&ndash;&ndash;with the regularity, of clock-work.</p>
<p>Tharon&#8217;s blue eyes were narrow as her father&#8217;s,
the little lines about them stood out. She rode
low, like a limpet clinging, and her mind was on
the two ahead&ndash;&ndash;the man and the great bay horse.</p>
<p>As she felt the wind sing by her cheeks, sting
the tears beneath her lids, she shut her lips tighter
and hugged the pommel closer.</p>
<p>The green carpet went by beneath her like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
blur. The thunder of El Rey&#8217;s beating hoofs
was like the sound of the cataracts when the ca&ntilde;ons
shot their freshets from the Rockface.</p>
<p>The note of his speed was rising&ndash;&ndash;rising&ndash;&ndash;rising.
The blood began to pound in her temples
with pride and exultation.</p>
<p>She saw the distance narrowing just the smallest
bit between her and Courtrey. Just the smallest
trifle, indeed, but <i>narrowing</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t a-puttin&#8217; Bolt down to his best,&#8221;
she told herself tensely, &#8220;I know what he can do.&#8221;
And she remembered that ride from the mouth
of Black Coulee to the pine-guarded glade&ndash;&ndash;and
Kenset. At that thought she pressed her lips
tighter.</p>
<p>No thought of Kenset must come to her now&ndash;&ndash;to
weaken her with memory of those pressing, vital
hands of his above his pounding heart.</p>
<p>No&ndash;&ndash;she was herself again&ndash;&ndash;Tharon Last, Jim
Last&#8217;s girl, the gun woman of Lost Valley&ndash;&ndash;and
yonder went her father&#8217;s killer.</p>
<p>She leaned down and called again in El Rey&#8217;s
ear.</p>
<p>No slightest spurt of speed rewarded her&ndash;&ndash;nothing
but the rising note. Then she saw that
the distance was widening&ndash;&ndash;just a tiny bit.</p>
<p>Truly it was widening. Courtrey, looking back,
had caught the sun on her golden hair, on her face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
as white as milk. He saw that her hands were at
her hips&ndash;&ndash;loosely set back at her hips&ndash;&ndash;and what
thought he might have had of mercy at her hands&ndash;&ndash;what
wild vision he might have seen of speech
with her&ndash;&ndash;of parley&ndash;&ndash;of persuasion&ndash;&ndash;was dead.</p>
<p>He leaned down and struck the Ironwood with
his open hand.</p>
<p>Bolt, the beautiful, leaped in answer. A little
more&ndash;&ndash;slowly&ndash;&ndash;the distance between pursuer and
pursued widened. Then&ndash;&ndash;Tharon blinked the
mist from her eyes to make sure&ndash;&ndash;the gain was
lost. Slowly, steadily, El Rey closed up the extra
width. Then for a time there was no change.
The open plain resounded to the roar of hoofs,
the wind sang by like taut strings struck. The
earth was still that racing green blur beneath.</p>
<p>And still the electric note of rising speed
hummed softly higher.</p>
<p>If Jim Last rode his silver stallion to the goal
of vengeance he must surely have been satisfied.
The great shoulders worked like pistons, the whole
massive body was level as the flowing floor beneath,
the steel-thewed limbs reached and doubled&ndash;&ndash;reached
and doubled&ndash;&ndash;with wonderful power
and precision.</p>
<p>And then at last Tharon knew&ndash;&ndash;knew that El
Rey was gaining, slowly, steadily, surely. The
splendid bay horse was running magnificently, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
El Rey ran like a super-horse. His silver head
was straight as a level, his ears laid back, his nostrils
wide and flaring, red as blood, his big eyes
glowed with the wildness of savage flight.</p>
<p>The great king was mad with speed!</p>
<p>Jim Last&#8217;s girl was mad also&ndash;&ndash;mad with the
lust of conquest, of revenge.</p>
<p>She rose a little from the stallion&#8217;s whipping
mane, and her blue eyes burned on the man ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d get you, Buck Courtrey!&#8221; she muttered,
&#8220;that some day I&#8217;d run th&#8217; Ironwoods off
their feet&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217; heart out of their master!</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, damn you&ndash;&ndash;for it&#8217;s your last ride!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she dropped forward again and watched
the distance closing down.</p>
<p>Nearer&ndash;&ndash;nearer&ndash;&ndash;nearer!</p>
<p>The note rose another notch.</p>
<p>Never in his life had El Rey run as he ran now.
Always he had had reserves. He had them now.
The bottom of his power was not reached.</p>
<p>Bolt was doing his best. Once he threw up his
head and foam flew on the wind&ndash;&ndash;red foam that
shot back and whipped on Tharon&#8217;s hand, a wet
pink stain, thinned and faded.</p>
<p>At that sight an exultant cry, savage, inhuman,
ugly, burst from her throat.</p>
<p>She was within long gunshot now&ndash;&ndash;was closing
her fingers lightly on the blue gun-butts&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>Courtrey heard that cry.</p>
<p>He rose in his saddle&ndash;&ndash;turned&ndash;&ndash;flashed up his
hand and fired. Quick as the motion of the gun
man was, Tharon Last was quicker. She dropped
over El Rey&#8217;s shoulder like a cat, firing as she
went.</p>
<p>Courtrey&#8217;s bullet clipped the cantle of the big
saddle an inch above her flattened leg across it.
Hers did something else&ndash;&ndash;what she had dreamed
of. It struck that other wrist of Courtrey&#8217;s, the
left&ndash;&ndash;and sent his six-gun tumbling.</p>
<p>Once again she yelled as she came back in her
saddle.</p>
<p>And El Rey was closing&ndash;&ndash;closing up the gap
between.</p>
<p>Once again Tharon raised her guns to shoot&ndash;&ndash;both,
this time, as her daddy had taught her.
This was the pinnacle of her life, her skill, her
training.</p>
<p>Never again would she live a moment like it.
She laughed and crouched for the final act.</p>
<p>But a sudden coldness went over her from head
to foot, sent the hot blood shaking down her
spine.</p>
<p>What was Courtrey doing?</p>
<p>He rode straight up at last, like an Indian
showing, and his bleeding left hand swung at his
side. With the other he had swept off his wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
hat, so that his handsome iron-grey head was bare
to the summer sun. His keen hawk face was
lifted. He made a spectacular figure&ndash;&ndash;like a warrior,
unarmed, waiting his end with courage.</p>
<p><i>Unarmed!</i></p>
<p>That it was which struck Tharon like a hand
across her face. The gun he had used with his
left hand was his only one! He had carried but
one since that night at the Stronghold when she
had first marked him.</p>
<p>She should have known! Word of this had
been about Corvan and the Valley.</p>
<p>And so she had Buck Courtrey at her mercy.
She could close the lessening gap and kill him in
his saddle&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But the icy blood still seemed to trickle down her
back.</p>
<p>She&ndash;&ndash;and Jim Last&ndash;&ndash;they had always fought in
fair-and-open. They were no murderers....
They did not strike in the dark&ndash;&ndash;shoot a man from
ambush&ndash;&ndash;nor kill a man unarmed.... And Kenset&ndash;&ndash;Kenset
of the foothills&ndash;&ndash;what had he said
about the stain of blood&ndash;&ndash;blood-guilt&ndash;&ndash;clean
hands&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The girl caught her breath with a choking sob.</p>
<p>The game was up.</p>
<p>Neither Jim Last&ndash;&ndash;nor Kenset&ndash;&ndash;nor she&ndash;&ndash;would
shoot a man unarmed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>And Courtrey was riding toward the Bottle
Neck.</p>
<p>He would go down the Wall to freedom.</p>
<p>And the crosses in Jim Last&#8217;s granite&ndash;&ndash;they
would be forever unredeemed, a shame, a sadness,
a living accusation!</p>
<p>Nay&ndash;&ndash;not that! Not that!</p>
<p>She had promised&ndash;&ndash;and the Law was waiting&ndash;&ndash;the
big Law of below.</p>
<p>She was Jim Last&#8217;s daughter still.</p>
<p>She leaned closer to El Rey&#8217;s neck&ndash;&ndash;held
her two guns ready&ndash;&ndash;and rode with the very
wind.</p>
<p>She was near now&ndash;&ndash;she could see Courtrey&#8217;s
face, waxen white but fearless, his dark eyes
turned back toward her in a sort of desperate admiration....
Courtrey loved strength and courage
and all things wild and fierce. She could
see Bolt&#8217;s staring eyeballs, his open mouth, gasping
and piteous. One more moment&ndash;&ndash;another&ndash;&ndash;yet
one more&ndash;&ndash;then she rose in her stirrups and
fired straight at the broad bay temple, shining and
black with sweat!</p>
<p>The great gallant Ironwood went down in a
huge arc&ndash;&ndash;first his beautiful head, then the sinking
arch of his neck, then the shoulders that had
worked so wondrously. He rolled on his back
like a hoop, his iron-shod hoofs spinning for one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
spectacular moment in the air. Then he lay at
sudden ease, his still fluttering nose pointing directly
back the way he had come.</p>
<p>With the first catching stumble of the true forefeet,
the man on his back had shot out of the
saddle and far ahead. He landed twenty feet
away and squarely on his head and shoulders. Like
Bolt, Courtrey&#8217;s body turned a complete somersault&ndash;&ndash;and
lay still, at sudden peace.</p>
<p>Tharon Last and El Rey went on like an arrow&ndash;&ndash;they
could not stop.</p>
<p>When at last she did draw the great king down
she was far and away from the spot. She turned
her head, panting and dizzy, and looked back....
She could see the prone red heap that was
Bolt&ndash;&ndash;a little way beyond that other, lesser, darker
heap....</p>
<p>For a long time she sat on El Rey&#8217;s heaving
back and stared unseeingly at the green earth
where the short grasses quivered in the little wind.</p>
<p>There was a deathly white line about her lips,
but her eyes blazed with the fire that had characterized
them from birth, the flickering, unfathomable
flame that came and went.</p>
<p>Then, presently, new lines came in her young
face, unstable lines that quivered and worked, and
all the good green earth danced grotesquely before
her vision, for a wall of tears shut out the world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
... She laid her head down on El Rey&#8217;s cloudy
mane&ndash;&ndash;and wept.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was early dawn at Last&#8217;s Holding. The sun
was not yet up behind the eastern ramparts. The
cottonwoods whispered in the dawn-wind, the
spring beneath the milk-house talked and murmured.
Out in the big corrals the cattle were
beginning to stir and bawl.</p>
<p>In the kitchen old Anita and young Paula had
breakfast waiting for the men.</p>
<p>Deep in that dim south room where the pale
Virgin kept watch and ward, Kenset of the foothills
slept in healing peace.</p>
<p>And at the step of the western door, Billy stood
by Golden&ndash;&ndash;Golden the beautiful, who ranked next
to El Rey himself&ndash;&ndash;and his face was lifted to
Tharon who drooped against the lintel with her
forehead on her arm.</p>
<p>The boy held her hand clasped in both of
his own, and there was a yearning tenderness
in his soft voice when he spoke, a pride and joy
ineffable that glowed above the pain that was
never to leave him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t that I love you less, Tharon, dear,&#8221;
he said gently, &#8220;that I must go. Not that, little
girl. I&#8217;ll love you till I die&ndash;&ndash;that I know in dead
certainty. But I can&#8217;t stay here&ndash;&ndash;not where I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
have to see you givin&#8217; all your sweet self to another
man. A good man, too, Tharon&ndash;&ndash;I think there
ain&#8217;t a better one in th&#8217; land&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;well,&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
all. I can&#8217;t thank you for all you&#8217;ve done
for me sence you was a little mite of a girl&ndash;&ndash;five
years back,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his voice broke a bit, but he controlled
it, &#8220;nor for th&#8217; joy you&#8217;ve given me&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217;
rides together&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; th&#8217; jokes an&#8217; playin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, unhappily, and the mistress
of Last&#8217;s drooped more heavily against the
old adobe wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor for Golden here,&#8221; went on the rider,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll be pals as long as we both live&ndash;&ndash;nor fer-fer&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
he stopped again, hesitated, looked yearningly
at the quivering cheek against the curving
arm, and went on to the finish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor fer that one kiss, Tharon&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s my one
treasure for life, so help me, God&ndash;&ndash;that you give
me that night. An&#8217; over all I want to thank you
fer&ndash;&ndash;fer&ndash;&ndash;killin&#8217; th&#8217; Pomo half-breed in th&#8217; Cup
o&#8217; God&ndash;&ndash;<i>fer you done that trick fer me</i>! Th&#8217; one
stain on your dear hands&ndash;&ndash;fer me&ndash;&ndash;the <i>only</i> one,
fer Fate killed Courtrey, not you. His neck was
clean broke when they picked him up.... That
memory will keep me alive, will save th&#8217; beauty
of th&#8217; stars at night fer me, will make th&#8217; rest
worth livin&#8217;.... That one kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped again and stood for a long time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
looking at her as if he would fix forever in his
memory the beauty of her, the fire, the spirit, the
elusive quality that was Tharon Last herself.</p>
<p>Then he sighed and smiled and gently shook
the hand he held.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come&ndash;&ndash;tell me good-bye, Tharon, dear,&#8221; he
said softly.</p>
<p>For answer the mistress of Last&#8217;s once again
reached out her arms and drew his head to her
heart&ndash;&ndash;once more pressed her lips upon his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy,&#8221; she said with a sound of tears in
her voice, &#8220;Kenset&#8217;s th&#8217; one man&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s true, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m helpless before th&#8217; fact&ndash;&ndash;but there&#8217;ll never be
another can take your place in my heart&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;ll
never be no one to ride with me in th&#8217; Big Shadow
in just th&#8217; same way, Billy&ndash;&ndash;to hold my hand as
we come home to Last&#8217;s with that same sweet, honest
friendship, that don&#8217;t need words! I&#8217;ve got
my life-love, but I&#8217;ve lost my life-friend&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; my
heart&#8217;s sore&ndash;&ndash;sore with pain!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rider lifted his face and it was glorified in
the first rays of the sun that was rising over the
eastern mountains. His gayly studded belt and
riding cuffs, his spurs and the vanity of silver on
his wide hat caught the glow and sparkled brightly.
Joy became paramount over sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret, Tharon,&#8221; he said, still in that
soft voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m always at your shoulder in spirit&ndash;&ndash;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
body, too, if you ever want me or need me.
So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he kissed both the hands he held, dropped
them, turned and mounted Golden, waved a hand
to all the Holding, and putting the horse to a run,
went down the sounding-board as if he dared not
look back.</p>
<p>Until horse and rider were a tiny speck on the
living green&ndash;&ndash;until they passed the Silver Hollow
and the mouth of Black Coulee, Tharon Last stood
in the western door and watched them with dim
blue eyes.</p>
<p>Ail the wide expanse of Lost Valley was still
and sweet with dawn, smiling as if with a new
and wondrous peace, the Vestal&#8217;s Veil shimmered
on the Rockface, the distant peaks above the
Ca&ntilde;on Country cut the skies.</p>
<p>She scanned the little world about and felt this
peace press down upon her soul&ndash;&ndash;as if the questions
all were answered, the duty done.</p>
<p>Never in all her life before had Last&#8217;s Holding
seemed to her so secure and settled, so sweet and
to be desired....</p>
<p>Within it lay her destiny&ndash;&ndash;the man in the cool
south room.</p>
<p>Without in the great Valley lay a future.</p>
<p>Love was with her&ndash;&ndash;friendship would be with
her always in memory, one glowing with its vital
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
presence, the other softened and doubly sweet with
the sorrow of absence.</p>
<p>She raised her hand and made the sign of the
Cross between herself and that disappearing
speck, then she turned and followed old Anita
carrying gruels to that dim south room.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>THE END</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
